	Abstract = {Motivation: Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical applications of computational biology, including applications such as gene and SNP selection from high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness of such selection processes has received attention only recently. However, robustness of biomarkers is an important issue, as it may greatly influence subsequent biological validations. In addition, a more robust set of markers may strengthen the confidence of an expert in the results of a selection method.Results: Our first contribution is a general framework for the analysis of the robustness of a biomarker selection algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the recently introduced concept of ensemble feature selection, where multiple feature selections are combined in order to increase the robustness of the final set of selected features. We focus on selection methods that are embedded in the estimation of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful classification models that have shown state-of-the-art performance on several diagnosis and prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection extensions also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show that the robustness of SVMs for biomarker discovery can be substantially increased by using ensemble feature selection techniques, while at the same time improving upon classification performances. The proposed methodology is evaluated on four microarray datasets showing increases of up to almost 30{\%} in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along with an improvement of ∼15{\%} in classification performance. The stability improvement with ensemble methods is particularly noticeable for small signature sizes (a few tens of genes), which is most relevant for the design of a diagnosis or prognosis model from a gene signature.Contact:yvan.saeys{\char64}psb.ugent.beSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {Despite decades of accumulated knowledge about proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs), numerous questions remain regarding their molecular composition and biological function. One of the most fundamental queries is the extent to which the combinations of DNA-, RNA- and PTM-level variations explode the complexity of the human proteome. Here, we outline what we know from current databases and measurement strategies including mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In doing so, we examine prevailing notions about the number of modifications displayed on human proteins and how they combine to generate the protein diversity underlying health and disease. We frame central issues regarding determination of protein-level variation and PTMs, including some paradoxes present in the field today. We use this framework to assess existing data and to ask the question, "How many distinct primary structures of proteins (proteoforms) are created from the 20,300 human genes?" We also explore prospects for improving measurements to better regularize protein-level biology and efficiently associate PTMs to function and phenotype.},

	Abstract = {This review takes a sceptical view of the impact of breast cancer studies that have used microarrays to identify predictors of clinical outcome. In addition to discussing general pitfalls of microarray experiments, we also critically review the key breast cancer studies to highlight methodological problems in cohort selection, statistical analysis, validation of results and reporting of raw data. We conclude that the optimum use of microarrays in clinical studies requires further optimisation and standardisation of methodology and reporting, together with improvements in clinical study design.},

The response of BRAF mutant colorectal cancer to recent targeted strategies such as anti-BRAF or combinations with MEK and EGFR inhibitors remains limited and highly heterogeneous within BRAF V600E cohorts. There is clearly an unmet need in understanding the biology of BRAF V600E colorectal cancers and potential subgroups within this population.Experimental Design: In the biggest yet reported cohort of 218 BRAF V600E with gene expression data, we performed unsupervised clustering using non-negative matrix factorization to identify gene expression--based subgroups and characterized pathway activation.Results: We found strong support for a split into two distinct groups, called BM1 and BM2. These subtypes are independent of MSI status, PI3K mutation, gender, and sidedness. Pathway analyses revealed that BM1 is characterized by KRAS/AKT pathway activation, mTOR/4EBP deregulation, and EMT whereas BM2 displays important deregulation of the cell cycle. Proteomics data validated these observations as BM1 is characterized by high phosphorylation levels of AKT and 4EBP1, and BM2 patients display high CDK1 and low cyclin D1 levels. We provide a global assessment of gene expression motifs that differentiate BRAF V600E subtypes from other colorectal cancers.Conclusions: We suggest that BRAF mutant patients should not be considered as having a unique biology and provide an in depth characterization of heterogeneous motifs that may be exploited for drug targeting.

	Abstract = {In vitro incubation of nanomaterials with plasma offer insights on biological interactions, but cannot fully explain the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Here, we use a library of polymer nanoparticles to show how physicochemical characteristics influence blood circulation and early distribution. For particles with different diameters, surface hydrophilicity appears to mediate early clearance. Densities above a critical value of approximately 20 poly(ethylene glycol) chains (MW 5 kDa) per 100 nm(2) prolong circulation times, irrespective of size. In knockout mice, clearance mechanisms are identified for nanoparticles with low and high steric protection. Studies in animals deficient in the C3 protein showed that complement activation could not explain differences in the clearance of nanoparticles. In nanoparticles with low poly(ethylene glycol) coverage, adsorption of apolipoproteins can prolong circulation times. In parallel, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor plays a predominant role in the clearance of nanoparticles, irrespective of poly(ethylene glycol) density. These results further our understanding of nanopharmacology.Understanding the interaction between nanoparticles and biomolecules is crucial for improving current drug-delivery systems. Here, the authors shed light on the essential role of the surface and other physicochemical properties of a library of nanoparticles on their in vivo pharmacokinetics.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale, unbiased proteomics studies are constrained by the complexity of the plasma proteome. Here we report a highly parallel protein quantitation platform integrating nanoparticle (NP) protein coronas with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for efficient proteomic profiling. A protein corona is a protein layer adsorbed onto NPs upon contact with biofluids. Varying the physicochemical properties of engineered NPs translates to distinct protein corona patterns enabling differential and reproducible interrogation of biological samples, including deep sampling of the plasma proteome. Spike experiments confirm a linear signal response. The median coefficient of variation was 22%. We screened 43 NPs and selected a panel of 5, which detect more than 2,000 proteins from 141 plasma samples using a 96-well automated workflow in a pilot non-small cell lung cancer classification study. Our streamlined workflow combines depth of coverage and throughput with precise quantification based on unique interactions between proteins and NPs engineered for deep and scalable quantitative proteomic studies.},

The following recommendations were endorsed at the workshop. (a) The form of genomic instability associated with defective DNA mismatch repair in tumors is to be called microsatellite instability (MSI). (b) A panel of five microsatellites has been validated and is recommended as a reference panel for future research in the field. Tumors may be characterized on the basis of: high-frequency MSI (MSI-H), if two or more of the five markers show instability (i.e., have insertion/deletion mutations), and low-frequency MSI (MSI-L), if only one of the five markers shows instability. The distinction between microsatellite stable (MSS) and low frequency MSI (MSI-L) can only be accomplished if a greater number of markers is utilized. (c) A unique clinical and pathological phenotype is identified for the MSI-H tumors, which comprise ∼15{\%} of colorectal cancers, whereas MSI-L and MSS tumors appear to be phenotypically similar. MSI-H colorectal tumors are found predominantly in the proximal colon, have unique histopathological features, and are associated with a less aggressive clinical course than are stage-matched MSI-L or MSS tumors. Preclinical models suggest the possibility that these tumors may be resistant to the cytotoxicity induced by certain chemotherapeutic agents. The implications for MSI-L are not yet clear. (d) MSI can be measured in fresh or fixed tumor specimens equally well; microdissection of pathological specimens is recommended to enrich for neoplastic tissue; and normal tissue is required to document the presence of MSI. (e) The ``Bethesda guidelines,''which were developed in 1996 to assist in the selection of tumors for microsatellite analysis, are endorsed. (f) The spectrum of microsatellite alterations in noncolonic tumors was reviewed, and it was concluded that the above recommendations apply only to colorectal neoplasms. (g) A research agenda was recommended. {\copyright}1998 American Association for Cancer Research.},

Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.Contact: bolstad@stat.berkeley.edu.Supplementary information: Additional figures may be found at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/normalize/index.html*To whom correspondence should be addressed.},

We critically review two main applications of expression profiling; studies unraveling novel breast cancer classifications and those that aim to identify novel markers for prediction of clinical outcome. Breast cancer may now be subclassified into luminal, basal, and HER2 subtypes with distinct differences in prognosis and response to therapy. However, profiling studies to identify predictive markers have suffered from methodologic problems that prevent general application of their results. Future work will need to reanalyze existing microarray data sets to identify more representative sets of candidate genes for use as prognostic signatures and will need to take into account the new knowledge of molecular subtypes of breast cancer when assessing predictive effects.},

	Abstract = {Comprehensive, high throughput analysis of the plasma proteome has the potential to enable holistic analysis of the health state of an individual. Based on our own experience and the evaluation of recent large-scale plasma mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic studies, we identified two outstanding challenges: slow and delicate nano-flow liquid chromatography (LC) and irreproducibility of identification of data-dependent acquisition (DDA). We determined an optimal solution reducing these limitations with robust capillary-flow data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS. This platform can measure 31 plasma proteomes per day. Using this setup, we acquired a large-scale plasma study of the diet, obesity and genes dietary (DiOGenes) comprising 1508 samples. Proving the robustness, the complete acquisition was achieved on a single analytical column. Totally, 565 proteins (459 identified with two or more peptide sequences) were profiled with 74{\%} data set completeness. On average 408 proteins (5246 peptides) were identified per acquisition (319 proteins in 90{\%} of all acquisitions). The workflow reproducibility was assessed using 34 quality control pools acquired at regular intervals, resulting in 92{\%} data set completeness with CVs for protein measurements of 10.9{\%}.The profiles of 20 apolipoproteins could be profiled revealing distinct changes. The weight loss and weight maintenance resulted in sustained effects on low-grade inflammation, as well as steroid hormone and lipid metabolism, indicating beneficial effects. Comparison to other large-scale plasma weight loss studies demonstrated high robustness and quality of biomarker candidates identified. Tracking of nonenzymatic glycation indicated a delayed, slight reduction of glycation in the weight maintenance phase. Using stable-isotope-references, we could directly and absolutely quantify 60 proteins in the DIA.In conclusion, we present herein the first large-scale plasma DIA study and one of the largest clinical research proteomic studies to date. Application of this fast and robust workflow has great potential to advance biomarker discovery in plasma.},

	Abstract = {Discovery and validation of plasma biomarkers are quite challenging because of the high complexity and wide dynamic range of the plasma proteome. Current plasma protein profiling strategies usually use major protein immunodepletion and nanoLC-MS/MS as the first and final analytical steps, respectively, but additional fractionation is needed to detect and quantify low-abundance disease biomarkers. In this study, the performances of 1-D SDS-PAGE, peptide isoelectrofocusing, and peptide high pH reverse-phase chromatography for fractionation of immunodepleted human plasma were systematically compared by evaluating protein coverage, peptide resolution, and capacity to detect known low-abundance proteins. Trade-offs between increasing the number of fractions to improve proteome coverage and resulting decreases in throughput also were assessed. High pH reverse-phase HPLC exhibited the highest peptide resolution and yielded the best depth of analysis with detection of the largest number of known low-abundance proteins for a given level of fractionation. Another advantage of using high pH reverse-phase fractionation rather than 1-D SDS gels is that all fractionation steps except for abundant protein depletion occur at the peptide level, making this strategy more compatible with quantitative biomarker validation methods such as stable isotope dilution multiple reaction monitoring.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput omics data often contain systematic biases introduced during various steps of sample processing and data generation. As the source of these biases is usually unknown, it is difficult to select an optimal normalization method for a given data set. To facilitate this process, we introduce the open-source tool "Normalyzer". It normalizes the data with 12 different normalization methods and generates a report with several quantitative and qualitative plots for comparative evaluation of different methods. The usefulness of Normalyzer is demonstrated with three different case studies from quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics. The results from these case studies show that the choice of normalization method strongly influences the outcome of downstream quantitative comparisons. Normalyzer is an R package and can be used locally or through the online implementation at http://quantitativeproteomics.org/normalyzer .},

	Abstract = {When nanoparticles (NPs) are dispersed in a biofluid, they are covered by a protein corona the composition of which strongly depends on the protein source. Recent studies demonstrated that the type of disease has a crucial role in the protein composition of the NP corona with relevant implications on personalized medicine. Proteomic variations frequently occur in cancer with the consequence that the bio-identity of NPs in the blood of cancer patients may differ from that acquired after administration to healthy volunteers. In this study we investigated the correlation between alterations of plasma proteins in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer and the biological identity of clinically approved AmBisome-like liposomes as determined by a combination of dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analysis, one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-SDS-PAGE) and semi-quantitative densitometry. While size of liposome-protein complexes was not significantly different between cancer groups, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was significantly less negatively charged. Of note, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was more enriched than those of other cancer types this enrichment being most likely due to IgA and IgG with possible correlations with the autoantibodies productions in cancer. Given the strict relationship between tumor antigen-specific autoantibodies and early cancer detection, our results could be the basis for the development of novel nanoparticle-corona-based screening tests of cancer.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative proteomics employing mass spectrometry is an indispensable tool in life science research. Targeted proteomics has emerged as a powerful approach for reproducible quantification but is limited in the number of proteins quantified. SWATH-mass spectrometry consists of data-independent acquisition and a targeted data analysis strategy that aims to maintain the favorable quantitative characteristics (accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity) of targeted proteomics at large scale. While previous SWATH-mass spectrometry studies have shown high intra-lab reproducibility, this has not been evaluated between labs. In this multi-laboratory evaluation study including 11 sites worldwide, we demonstrate that using SWATH-mass spectrometry data acquisition we can consistently detect and reproducibly quantify >4000 proteins from HEK293 cells. Using synthetic peptide dilution series, we show that the sensitivity, dynamic range and reproducibility established with SWATH-mass spectrometry are uniformly achieved. This study demonstrates that the acquisition of reproducible quantitative proteomics data by multiple labs is achievable, and broadly serves to increase confidence in SWATH-mass spectrometry data acquisition as a reproducible method for large-scale protein quantification.SWATH-mass spectrometry consists of a data-independent acquisition and a targeted data analysis strategy that aims to maintain the favorable quantitative characteristics on the scale of thousands of proteins. Here, using data generated by eleven groups worldwide, the authors show that SWATH-MS is capable of generating highly reproducible data across different laboratories.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer develops through two main genetic instability pathways characterized by distinct pathologic features and clinical outcome. RESULTS: We investigated colon cancer samples (23 characterized by microsatellite stability, MSS, and 16 by high microsatellite instability, MSI-H) for genome-wide expression of microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA. Based on combined miRNA and mRNA gene expression, a molecular signature consisting of twenty seven differentially expressed genes, inclusive of 8 miRNAs, could correctly distinguish MSI-H versus MSS colon cancer samples. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, various members of the oncogenic miR-17-92 family were significantly up-regulated in MSS cancers. The majority of protein coding genes were also up-regulated in MSS cancers. Their functional classification revealed that they were most frequently associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, repair, gastrointestinal disease and immune response. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that indicates the existence of differences in miRNA expression between MSS versus MSI-H colorectal cancers. In addition, the work suggests that the combination of mRNA/miRNA expression signatures may represent a general approach for improving bio-molecular classification of human cancer.},

@article{Daly:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Comparing a protein's concentrations across two or more treatments is the focus of many proteomics studies. A frequent source of measurements for these comparisons is a mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of a protein's peptide ions separated by liquid chromatography (LC) following its enzymatic digestion. Alas, LC-MS identification and quantification of equimolar peptides can vary significantly due to their unequal digestion, separation, and ionization. This unequal measurability of peptides, the largest source of LC-MS nuisance variation, stymies confident comparison of a protein's concentration across treatments. Our objective is to introduce a mixed-effects statistical model for comparative LC-MS proteomics studies. We describe LC-MS peptide abundance with a linear model featuring pivotal terms that account for unequal peptide LC-MS measurability. We advance fitting this model to an often incomplete LC-MS data set with REstricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation, producing estimates of model goodness-of-fit, treatment effects, standard errors, confidence intervals, and protein relative concentrations. We illustrate the model with an experiment featuring a known dilution series of a filamentous ascomycete fungus Trichoderma reesei protein mixture. For 781 of the 1546 T. reesei proteins with sufficient data coverage, the fitted mixed-effects models capably described the LC-MS measurements. The LC-MS measurability terms effectively accounted for this major source of uncertainty. Ninety percent of the relative concentration estimates were within 0.5-fold of the true relative concentrations. Akin to the common ratio method, this model also produced biased estimates, albeit less biased. Bias decreased significantly, both absolutely and relative to the ratio method, as the number of observed peptides per protein increased. Mixed-effects statistical modeling offers a flexible, well-established methodology for comparative proteomics studies integrating common experimental designs with LC-MS sample processing plans. It favorably accounts for the unequal LC-MS measurability of peptides and produces informative quantitative comparisons of a protein's concentration across treatments with objective measures of uncertainties.},

One popular analysis method involves fitting the same linear mixed model for each gene, obtaining gene-specific p-values for tests of interest involving fixed effects, and then choosing a threshold for significance that is intended to control false discovery rate (FDR) at a desired level. When one or more random factors have zero variance components for some genes, the standard practice of fitting the same full linear mixed model for all genes can result in failure to control FDR. We propose a new method that combines results from the fit of full and selected linear mixed models to identify differentially expressed genes and provide FDR control at target levels when the true underlying random effects structure varies across genes.},

Here we present formulae for determining sample sizes to achieve a variety of experimental goals, including class comparison and the development of prognostic markers. Results are derived which describe the impact of pooling, technical replicates and dye-swap arrays on sample size requirements. These results are shown to depend on the relative sizes of different sources of variability. A variety of common types of experimental situations and designs used with single-label and dual-label microarrays are considered. We discuss procedures for controlling the false discovery rate.

	Abstract = {Many gene expression studies attempt to develop a predictor of pre-defined diagnostic or prognostic classes. If the classes are similar biologically, then the number of genes that are differentially expressed between the classes is likely to be small compared to the total number of genes measured. This motivates a two-step process for predictor development, a subset of differentially expressed genes is selected for use in the predictor and then the predictor constructed from these. Both these steps will introduce variability into the resulting classifier, so both must be incorporated in sample size estimation. We introduce a methodology for sample size determination for prediction in the context of high-dimensional data that captures variability in both steps of predictor development. The methodology is based on a parametric probability model, but permits sample size computations to be carried out in a practical manner without extensive requirements for preliminary data. We find that many prediction problems do not require a large training set of arrays for classifier development.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: A common goal of gene expression microarray studies is the development of a classifier that can be used to divide patients into groups with different prognoses, or with different expected responses to a therapy. These types of classifiers are developed on a training set, which is the set of samples used to train a classifier. The question of how many samples are needed in the training set to produce a good classifier from high-dimensional microarray data is challenging. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We present a model-based approach to determining the sample size required to adequately train a classifier. RESULTS: It is shown that sample size can be determined from three quantities: standardized fold change, class prevalence, and number of genes or features on the arrays. Numerous examples and important experimental design issues are discussed. The method is adapted to address ex post facto determination of whether the size of a training set used to develop a classifier was adequate. An interactive web site for performing the sample size calculations is provided. CONCLUSION: We showed that sample size calculations for classifier development from high-dimensional microarray data are feasible, discussed numerous important considerations, and presented examples.},

An important statistical question associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene expression profiles. Essential aspects of this clustering problem include identifying accurate partitions of the tumor samples into clusters and assessing the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples.Results: Two new resampling methods, inspired from bagging in prediction, are proposed to improve and assess the accuracy of a given clustering procedure. In these ensemble methods, a partitioning clustering procedure is applied to bootstrap learning sets and the resulting multiple partitions are combined by voting or the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix. As in prediction, the motivation behind bagging is to reduce variability in the partitioning results via averaging. The performances of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene expression data from two recently published cancer microarray studies. The bagged clustering procedures were in general at least as accurate and often substantially more accurate than a single application of the partitioning clustering procedure. A valuable by-product of bagged clustering are the cluster votes which can be used to assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual observationsContact: sandrine@stat.berkeley.eduSupplementary information: For supplementary information on datasets, analyses, and software, consult http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sandrine and http://www.bioconductor.org.*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

	Abstract = {Motivation: Predicting the metastatic potential of primary malignant tissues has direct bearing on the choice of therapy. Several microarray studies yielded gene sets whose expression profiles successfully predicted survival. Nevertheless, the overlap between these gene sets is almost zero. Such small overlaps were observed also in other complex diseases, and the variables that could account for the differences had evoked a wide interest. One of the main open questions in this context is whether the disparity can be attributed only to trivial reasons such as different technologies, different patients and different types of analyses.Results: To answer this question, we concentrated on a single breast cancer dataset, and analyzed it by a single method, the one which was used by van't Veer et al. to produce a set of outcome-predictive genes. We showed that, in fact, the resulting set of genes is not unique; it is strongly influenced by the subset of patients used for gene selection. Many equally predictive lists could have been produced from the same analysis. Three main properties of the data explain this sensitivity: (1) many genes are correlated with survival; (2) the differences between these correlations are small; (3) the correlations fluctuate strongly when measured over different subsets of patients. A possible biological explanation for these properties is discussed.Contact:eytan.domany{\char64}weizmann.ac.ilSupplementary information:http://www.weizmann.ac.il/physics/complex/compphys/downloads/liate/},

	Abstract = {Predicting at the time of discovery the prognosis and metastatic potential of cancer is a major challenge in current clinical research. Numerous recent studies searched for gene expression signatures that outperform traditionally used clinical parameters in outcome prediction. Finding such a signature will free many patients of the suffering and toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy given to them under current protocols, even though they do not need such treatment. A reliable set of predictive genes also will contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanism of metastasis. Several groups have published lists of predictive genes and reported good predictive performance based on them. However, the gene lists obtained for the same clinical types of patients by different groups differed widely and had only very few genes in common. This lack of agreement raised doubts about the reliability and robustness of the reported predictive gene lists, and the main source of the problem was shown to be the small number of samples that were used to generate the gene lists. Here, we introduce a previously undescribed mathematical method, probably approximately correct (PAC) sorting, for evaluating the robustness of such lists. We calculate for several published data sets the number of samples that are needed to achieve any desired level of reproducibility. For example, to achieve a typical overlap of 50{\%} between two predictive lists of genes, breast cancer studies would need the expression profiles of several thousand early discovery patients.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The standard paradigm for a classifier design is to obtain a sample of feature-label pairs and then to apply a classification rule to derive a classifier from the sample data. Typically in laboratory situations the sample size is limited by cost, time or availability of sample material. Thus, an investigator may wish to consider a sequential approach in which there is a sufficient number of patients to train a classifier in order to make a sound decision for diagnosis while at the same time keeping the number of patients as small as possible to make the studies affordable.Results: A sequential classification procedure is studied via the martingale central limit theorem. It updates the classification rule at each step and provides stopping criteria to ensure with a certain confidence that at stopping a future subject will have misclassification probability smaller than a predetermined threshold. Simulation studies and applications to microarray data analysis are provided. The procedure possesses several attractive properties: (1) it updates the classification rule sequentially and thus does not rely on distributions of primary measurements from other studies; (2) it assesses the stopping criteria at each sequential step and thus can substantially reduce cost via early stopping; and (3) it is not restricted to any particular classification rule and therefore applies to any parametric or non-parametric method, including feature selection or extraction.Availability: R-code for the sequential stopping rule is available at http://stat.tamu.edu/\~{}wfu/microarray/sequential/R-code.htmlContact:wfu{\char64}stat.tamu.edu},

Many methods have been proposed to adjust microarray data to mitigate the problems of unwanted variation. Several of these methods rely on factor analysis to infer the unwanted variation from the data. A central problem with this approach is the difficulty in discerning the unwanted variation from the biological variation that is of interest to the researcher. We present a new method, intended for use in differential expression studies, that attempts to overcome this problem by restricting the factor analysis to negative control genes. Negative control genes are genes known a priori not to be differentially expressed with respect to the biological factor of interest. Variation in the expression levels of these genes can therefore be assumed to be unwanted variation. We name this method ``Remove Unwanted Variation, 2-step''(RUV-2). We discuss various techniques for assessing the performance of an adjustment method and compare the performance of RUV-2 with that of other commonly used adjustment methods such as Combat and Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA). We present several example studies, each concerning genes differentially expressed with respect to gender in the brain and find that RUV-2 performs as well or better than other methods. Finally, we discuss the possibility of adapting RUV-2 for use in studies not concerned with differential expression and conclude that there may be promise but substantial challenges remain.},

The apolipoprotein family, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, gender-related proteins, and >40 FDA-approved biomarkers are reproducibly quantified (CV <20% with label-free quantification).

	Abstract = {Clinical analysis of blood is the most widespread diagnostic procedure in medicine, and blood biomarkers are used to categorize patients and to support treatment decisions. However, existing biomarkers are far from comprehensive and often lack specificity and new ones are being developed at a very slow rate. As described in this review, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful technology in biological research and it is now poised to allow the characterization of the plasma proteome in great depth. Previous "triangular strategies" aimed at discovering single biomarker candidates in small cohorts, followed by classical immunoassays in much larger validation cohorts. We propose a "rectangular" plasma proteome profiling strategy, in which the proteome patterns of large cohorts are correlated with their phenotypes in health and disease. Translating such concepts into clinical practice will require restructuring several aspects of diagnostic decision-making, and we discuss some first steps in this direction.},

To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression--based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (MSI Immune, 14{\%}), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable, strong immune activation; CMS2 (Canonical, 37{\%}), epithelial, chromosomally unstable, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 (Metabolic, 13{\%}), epithelial, evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4 (Mesenchymal, 23{\%}), prominent transforming growth factor βactivation, stromal invasion, and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13{\%}) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intra-tumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups the most robust classification system currently available for CRC --with clear biological interpretability --and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype--based targeted interventions.},

It is also extremely challenging from a statistical viewpoint, but surprisingly few studies have investigated the relative strengths and weaknesses of the plethora of existing feature selection methods. In this study we compare 32 feature selection methods on 4 public gene expression datasets for breast cancer prognosis, in terms of predictive performance, stability and functional interpretability of the signatures they produce. We observe that the feature selection method has a significant influence on the accuracy, stability and interpretability of signatures. Surprisingly, complex wrapper and embedded methods generally do not outperform simple univariate feature selection methods, and ensemble feature selection has generally no positive effect. Overall a simple Student's t-test seems to provide the best results.},

@article{Haury:2012aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inferring the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN) from a collection of gene expression data has many potential applications, from the elucidation of complex biological processes to the identification of potential drug targets. It is however a notoriously difficult problem, for which the many existing methods reach limited accuracy. RESULTS: In this paper, we formulate GRN inference as a sparse regression problem and investigate the performance of a popular feature selection method, least angle regression (LARS) combined with stability selection, for that purpose. We introduce a novel, robust and accurate scoring technique for stability selection, which improves the performance of feature selection with LARS. The resulting method, which we call TIGRESS (for Trustful Inference of Gene REgulation with Stability Selection), was ranked among the top GRN inference methods in the DREAM5 gene network inference challenge. In particular, TIGRESS was evaluated to be the best linear regression-based method in the challenge. We investigate in depth the influence of the various parameters of the method, and show that a fine parameter tuning can lead to significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance for GRN inference, in both directed and undirected settings. CONCLUSIONS: TIGRESS reaches state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data, including both in silico and in vivo (E. coli and S. cerevisiae) networks. This study confirms the potential of feature selection techniques for GRN inference. Code and data are available on http://cbio.ensmp.fr/tigress. Moreover, TIGRESS can be run online through the GenePattern platform (GP-DREAM, http://dream.broadinstitute.org).},

	Abstract = {We introduce a statistical model for microarray gene expression data that comprises data calibration, the quantification of differential expression, and the quantification of measurement error. In particular, we derive a transformation h for intensity measurements, and a difference statistic Deltah whose variance is approximately constant along the whole intensity range. This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses. For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x)=arsinh(a+bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and Deltah with the log-ratio. The parameters of h together with those of the calibration between experiments are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. We demonstrate our approach on data sets from different experimental platforms, including two-colour cDNA arrays and a series of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.},

Using two extensive spike‐in studies and a dilution study, we developed a set of tools for assessing the effectiveness of expression measures. We found that the performance of the current version of the default expression measure provided by Affymetrix Microarray Suite can be significantly improved by the use of probe level summaries derived from empirically motivated statistical models.

MSI-associated gene expression changes have been identified in colorectal cancers, but little overlap exists between signatures hindering an assessment of overall consistency. Little is known about the causes and downstream effects of differential gene expression. Experimental Design: DNA microarray data on 89 MSI and 140 microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancers from this study and 58 MSI and 77 MSS cases from three published reports were randomly divided into test and training sets. MSI-associated gene expression changes were assessed for cross-study consistency using training samples and validated as MSI classifier using test samples. Differences in biological pathways were identified by functional category analysis. Causation of differential gene expression was investigated by comparison to DNA copy-number data. Results: MSI-associated gene expression changes in colorectal cancers were found to be highly consistent across multiple studies of primary tumors and cancer cell lines from patients of different ethnicities (P \&lt; 0.001). Clustering based on consistent changes separated additional test cases by MSI status, and classification of individual samples predicted MSI status with a sensitivity of 96{\%} and specificity of 85{\%}. Genes associated with immune response were up-regulated in MSI cancers, whereas genes associated with cell-cell adhesion, ion binding, and regulation of metabolism were down-regulated. Differential gene expression was shown to reflect systematic differences in DNA copy-number aberrations between MSI and MSS tumors (P \&lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Our results show cross-study consistency of MSI-associated gene expression changes in colorectal cancers. DNA copy-number alterations partly cause the differences in gene expression between MSI and MSS cancers.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer prognosis is currently predicted from pathological staging, providing limited discrimination for Dukes'stage B and C disease. Additional markers for outcome are required to help guide therapy selection for individual patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A multi-site single-platform microarray study was performed on 553 colorectal cancers. Gene expression changes were identified between stage A and D tumors (three training sets) and assessed as a prognosis signature in stage B and C tumors (independent test and external validation sets). RESULTS: 128 genes showed reproducible expression changes between three sets of stage A and D cancers. Using consistent genes, stage B and C cancers clustered into two groups resembling early-stage and metastatic tumors. A Prediction Analysis of Microarray (PAM) algorithm was developed to classify individual intermediate-stage cancers into stage A-like/good prognosis or stage D-like/poor prognosis types. For stage B patients, the treatment adjusted hazard ratio for six-year recurrence in individuals with stage D-like cancers was 10.3 (95{\%} CI 1.3 to 80.0, P=0.011). For stage C patients, the adjusted hazard ratio was 2.9 (95{\%} CI 1.1 to 7.6, P=0.016). Similar results were obtained for an external set of stage B and C patients. The prognosis signature was enriched for down-regulated immune response genes and up-regulated cell signaling and extracellular matrix genes. Accordingly, sparse tumor infiltration with mononuclear chronic inflammatory cells was associated with poor outcome in independent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Metastasis-associated gene expression changes can be used to refine traditional outcome prediction, providing a rational approach for tailoring treatments to subsets of patients.},

	Abstract = {DIGE is a powerful tool for measuring changes in protein expression between samples. Here we assess the assumptions of normality and heterogeneity of variance that underlie the univariate statistical tests routinely used to detect proteins with expression changes. Furthermore, the technical variance experienced in a multigel experiment is assessed here and found to be reproducible within- and across-sample types. Utilising the technical variance measured, a power study is completed for several "typical" fold changes in expression commonly used as thresholds by researchers. Based on this study using DeCyder, guidance is given on the number of gel replicates that are needed for the experiment to have sufficient sensitivity to detect expression changes. A two-dye system based on utilising just Cy3 and Cy5 was found to be more reproducible than the three-dye system. A power and cost-benefit analysis performed here suggests that the traditional three-dye system would use fewer resources in studies where multiple samples are compared. Technical variance was shown to encompass both experimental and analytical noise and thus is dependent on the analytical software utilised. Data is provided as a resource to the community to assess alternative software and upgrades.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: LC-MS allows for the identification and quantification of proteins from biological samples. As with any high-throughput technology, systematic biases are often observed in LC-MS data, making normalization an important preprocessing step. Normalization models need to be flexible enough to capture biases of arbitrary complexity, while avoiding overfitting that would invalidate downstream statistical inference. Careful normalization of MS peak intensities would enable greater accuracy and precision in quantitative comparisons of protein abundance levels. RESULTS: We propose an algorithm, called EigenMS, that uses singular value decomposition to capture and remove biases from LC-MS peak intensity measurements. EigenMS is an adaptation of the surrogate variable analysis (SVA) algorithm of Leek and Storey, with the adaptations including (i) the handling of the widespread missing measurements that are typical in LC-MS, and (ii) a novel approach to preventing overfitting that facilitates the incorporation of EigenMS into an existing proteomics analysis pipeline. EigenMS is demonstrated using both large-scale calibration measurements and simulations to perform well relative to existing alternatives. AVAILABILITY: The software has been made available in the open source proteomics platform DAnTE (Polpitiya et al., 2008)) (http://omics.pnl.gov/software/), as well as in standalone software available at SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net).},

	Abstract = {Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry has become one of the analytical platforms of choice for metabolomics studies. However, LC-MS metabolomics data can suffer from the effects of various systematic biases. These include batch effects, day-to-day variations in instrument performance, signal intensity loss due to time-dependent effects of the LC column performance, accumulation of contaminants in the MS ion source and MS sensitivity among others. In this study we aimed to test a singular value decomposition-based method, called EigenMS, for normalization of metabolomics data. We analyzed a clinical human dataset where LC-MS serum metabolomics data and physiological measurements were collected from thirty nine healthy subjects and forty with type 2 diabetes and applied EigenMS to detect and correct for any systematic bias. EigenMS works in several stages. First, EigenMS preserves the treatment group differences in the metabolomics data by estimating treatment effects with an ANOVA model (multiple fixed effects can be estimated). Singular value decomposition of the residuals matrix is then used to determine bias trends in the data. The number of bias trends is then estimated via a permutation test and the effects of the bias trends are eliminated. EigenMS removed bias of unknown complexity from the LC-MS metabolomics data, allowing for increased sensitivity in differential analysis. Moreover, normalized samples better correlated with both other normalized samples and corresponding physiological data, such as blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin, exercise central augmentation pressure normalized to heart rate of 75, and total cholesterol. We were able to report 2578 discriminatory metabolite peaks in the normalized data (p<0.05) as compared to only 1840 metabolite signals in the raw data. Our results support the use of singular value decomposition-based normalization for metabolomics data.},

@article{Kim:2009aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few overlap between independently developed gene signatures and poor inter-study applicability of gene signatures are two of major concerns raised in the development of microarray-based prognostic gene signatures. One recent study suggested that thousands of samples are needed to generate a robust prognostic gene signature. RESULTS: A data set of 1,372 samples was generated by combining eight breast cancer gene expression data sets produced using the same microarray platform and, using the data set, effects of varying samples sizes on a few performances of a prognostic gene signature were investigated. The overlap between independently developed gene signatures was increased linearly with more samples, attaining an average overlap of 16.56{\%} with 600 samples. The concordance between predicted outcomes by different gene signatures also was increased with more samples up to 94.61{\%} with 300 samples. The accuracy of outcome prediction also increased with more samples. Finally, analysis using only Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) patients attained higher prediction accuracy than using both patients, suggesting that sub-type specific analysis can lead to the development of better prognostic gene signatures CONCLUSION: Increasing sample sizes generated a gene signature with better stability, better concordance in outcome prediction, and better prediction accuracy. However, the degree of performance improvement by the increased sample size was different between the degree of overlap and the degree of concordance in outcome prediction, suggesting that the sample size required for a study should be determined according to the specific aims of the study.},

Each drug target is linked to a disease using integrated genome-wide data from a broad range of data sources. The platform provides either a target-centric workflow to identify diseases that may be associated with a specific target, or a disease-centric workflow to identify targets that may be associated with a specific disease. Users can easily transition between these target- and disease-centric workflows. The Open Targets Validation Platform is accessible at https://www.targetvalidation.org.},

	Abstract = {Gene selection is an important step when building predictors of disease state based on gene expression data. Gene selection generally improves performance and identifies a relevant subset of genes. Many univariate and multivariate gene selection approaches have been proposed. Frequently the claim is made that genes are co-regulated (due to pathway dependencies) and that multivariate approaches are therefore per definition more desirable than univariate selection approaches. Based on the published performances of all these approaches a fair comparison of the available results can not be made. This mainly stems from two factors. First, the results are often biased, since the validation set is in one way or another involved in training the predictor, resulting in optimistically biased performance estimates. Second, the published results are often based on a small number of relatively simple datasets. Consequently no generally applicable conclusions can be drawn.},

This process is very challenging due to the diverse sources of information resulting from genomics experiments. In this work, we review methods designed to combine genomic data recorded from microarray gene expression (MAGE) experiments. It has been acknowledged that the main source of variation between different MAGE datasets is due to the so-called `batch effects'. The methods reviewed here perform data integration by removing (or more precisely attempting to remove) the unwanted variation associated with batch effects. They are presented in a unified framework together with a wide range of evaluation tools, which are mandatory in assessing the efficiency and the quality of the data integration process. We provide a systematic description of the MAGE data integration methodology together with some basic recommendation to help the users in choosing the appropriate tools to integrate MAGE data for large-scale analysis; and also how to evaluate them from different perspectives in order to quantify their efficiency.

The most well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effects---when samples are processed on different days, in different groups or by different people.

Here we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating and removing unwanted sources of variation in high-throughput experiments.

	Abstract = {Automated cell type identification is a key computational challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. To capitalise on the large collection of well-annotated scRNA-seq datasets, we developed scClassify, a multiscale classification framework based on ensemble learning and cell type hierarchies constructed from single or multiple annotated datasets as references. scClassify enables the estimation of sample size required for accurate classification of cell types in a cell type hierarchy and allows joint classification of cells when multiple references are available. We show that scClassify consistently performs better than other supervised cell type classification methods across 114 pairs of reference and testing data, representing a diverse combination of sizes, technologies and levels of complexity, and further demonstrate the unique components of scClassify through simulations and compendia of experimental datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of scClassify on large single-cell atlases and highlight a novel application of identifying subpopulations of cells from the Tabula Muris data that were unidentified in the original publication. Together, scClassify represents state-of-the-art methodology in automated cell type identification from scRNA-seq data.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of DNA microarray techniques has had dramatic implications on cancer research, allowing researchers to analyze expression of multiple genes in concert and relate the findings to clinical parameters. The main discoveries in breast cancer, as well as in other malignancies, have so far been with respect to two key issues. First, individual tumors arising from the same organ may be grouped into distinct classes based on their gene expression profiles, independent of stage and grade. Second, the biologic relevance of such classification is corroborated by significant prognostic impact. We review how the use of microarray technologies can provide unique possibilities to explore the mechanisms of tumor behavior in vivo that will allow evaluation of prognosis and, potentially, drug resistance. However, in spite of recent advances, we are not yet at a stage where the use of these techniques should be implemented for routine clinical use, whether to define prognostic factors or to predict sensitivity to therapy.},

However, these advances have been mainly limited to the MS2 level, whereas ion beam sampling for the MS1 scans remains extremely inefficient. Here we report a data-acquisition method, termed BoxCar, in which filling multiple narrow mass-to-charge segments increases the mean ion injection time more than tenfold as compared to that of a standard full scan. In 1-h analyses, the method provided MS1-level evidence for more than 90% of the proteome of a human cancer cell line that had previously been identified in 24 fractions, and it quantified more than 6,200 proteins in ten of ten replicates. In mouse brain tissue, we detected more than 10,000 proteins in only 100 min, and sensitivity extended into the low-attomolar range.},

	N2 = {Summary.? Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: General studies of microarray gene-expression profiling have been undertaken to predict cancer outcome. Knowledge of this gene-expression profile or molecular signature should improve treatment of patients by allowing treatment to be tailored to the severity of the disease. We reanalysed data from the seven largest published studies that have attempted to predict prognosis of cancer patients on the basis of DNA microarray analysis. METHODS: The standard strategy is to identify a molecular signature (ie, the subset of genes most differentially expressed in patients with different outcomes) in a training set of patients and to estimate the proportion of misclassifications with this signature on an independent validation set of patients. We expanded this strategy (based on unique training and validation sets) by using multiple random sets, to study the stability of the molecular signature and the proportion of misclassifications. FINDINGS: The list of genes identified as predictors of prognosis was highly unstable; molecular signatures strongly depended on the selection of patients in the training sets. For all but one study, the proportion misclassified decreased as the number of patients in the training set increased. Because of inadequate validation, our chosen studies published overoptimistic results compared with those from our own analyses. Five of the seven studies did not classify patients better than chance. INTERPRETATION: The prognostic value of published microarray results in cancer studies should be considered with caution. We advocate the use of validation by repeated random sampling.},

	Abstract = {Urinary biomarkers or profiles that allow noninvasive detection of recurrent transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder are urgently needed. We obtained duplicate proteomic (SELDI) profiles from 227 subjects (118 TCC, 77 healthy controls and 32 controls with benign urological conditions) and used linear mixed effects models to identify peaks that are differentially expressed between TCC and controls and within TCC subgroups. A Random Forest classifier was trained on 130 profiles to develop an algorithm to predict the presence of TCC in a randomly selected initial test set (n = 54) and an independent validation set (n = 43) several months later. Twenty two peaks were differentially expressed between all TCC and controls (p < 10(-7)). However potential confounding effects of age, sex and analytical run were identified. In an age-matched sub-set, 23 peaks were differentially expressed between TCC and combined benign and healthy controls at the 0.005 significance level. Using the Random Forest classifier, TCC was predicted with 71.7% sensitivity and 62.5% specificity in the initial set and with 78.3% sensitivity and 65.0% specificity in the validation set after 6 months, compared with controls. Several peaks of importance were also identified in the linear mixed effects model. We conclude that SELDI profiling of urine samples can identify patients with TCC with comparable sensitivities and specificities to current tumor marker tests. This is the first time that reproducibility has been demonstrated on an independent test set analyzed several months later. Identification of the relevant peaks may facilitate multiplex marker assay development for detection of recurrent disease.},

In this approach, customized protein sequence databases generated using genomic and transcriptomic information are used to help identify novel peptides (not present in reference protein sequence databases) from mass spectrometry-based proteomic data; in turn, the proteomic data can be used to provide protein-level evidence of gene expression and to help refine gene models. In recent years, owing to the emergence of new sequencing technologies such as RNA-seq and dramatic improvements in the depth and throughput of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the pace of proteogenomic research has greatly accelerated. Here I review the current state of proteogenomic methods and applications, including computational strategies for building and using customized protein sequence databases. I also draw attention to the challenge of false positive identifications in proteogenomics and provide guidelines for analyzing the data and reporting the results of proteogenomic studies.},

	Abstract = {Reproducible research is the bedrock of experimental science. To enable the deployment of large-scale proteomics, we assess the reproducibility of mass spectrometry (MS) over time and across instruments and develop computational methods for improving quantitative accuracy. We perform 1560 data independent acquisition (DIA)-MS runs of eight samples containing known proportions of ovarian and prostate cancer tissue and yeast, or control HEK293T cells. Replicates are run on six mass spectrometers operating continuously with varying maintenance schedules over four months, interspersed with \~{}5000 other runs. We utilise negative controls and replicates to remove unwanted variation and enhance biological signal, outperforming existing methods. We also design a method for reducing missing values. Integrating these computational modules into a pipeline (ProNorM), we mitigate variation among instruments over time and accurately predict tissue proportions. We demonstrate how to improve the quantitative analysis of large-scale DIA-MS data, providing a pathway toward clinical proteomics.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the assay of choice for high-throughput studies of gene expression. However, as is the case with microarrays, major technology-related artifacts and biases affect the resulting expression measures. Normalization is therefore essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels and subsequent analyses thereof. RESULTS: We focus on biases related to GC-content and demonstrate the existence of strong sample-specific GC-content effects on RNA-Seq read counts, which can substantially bias differential expression analysis. We propose three simple within-lane gene-level GC-content normalization approaches and assess their performance on two different RNA-Seq datasets, involving different species and experimental designs. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art normalization procedures in terms of bias and mean squared error for expression fold-change estimation and in terms of Type I error and p-value distributions for tests of differential expression. The exploratory data analysis and normalization methods proposed in this article are implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R package EDASeq. CONCLUSIONS: Our within-lane normalization procedures, followed by between-lane normalization, reduce GC-content bias and lead to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression. Such results are crucial for the biological interpretation of RNA-Seq experiments, where downstream analyses can be sensitive to the supplied lists of genes.},

	Abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

We shrink the prototypes and hence obtain a classifier that is often more accurate than competing methods. Our method of ``nearest shrunken centroids''identifies subsets of genes that best characterize each class. The technique is general and can be used in many other classification problems. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show that the method was highly efficient in finding genes for classifying small round blue cell tumors and leukemias.},

	Abstract = {To date, mass spectrometry (MS) data remain inherently biased as a result of reasons ranging from sample handling to differences caused by the instrumentation. Normalization is the process that aims to account for the bias and make samples more comparable. The selection of a proper normalization method is a pivotal task for the reliability of the downstream analysis and results. Many normalization methods commonly used in proteomics have been adapted from the DNA microarray techniques. Previous studies comparing normalization methods in proteomics have focused mainly on intragroup variation. In this study, several popular and widely used normalization methods representing different strategies in normalization are evaluated using three spike-in and one experimental mouse label-free proteomic data sets. The normalization methods are evaluated in terms of their ability to reduce variation between technical replicates, their effect on differential expression analysis and their effect on the estimation of logarithmic fold changes. Additionally, we examined whether normalizing the whole data globally or in segments for the differential expression analysis has an effect on the performance of the normalization methods. We found that variance stabilization normalization (Vsn) reduced variation the most between technical replicates in all examined data sets. Vsn also performed consistently well in the differential expression analysis. Linear regression normalization and local regression normalization performed also systematically well. Finally, we discuss the choice of a normalization method and some qualities of a suitable normalization method in the light of the results of our evaluation.},

Our aim is to clarify DNA methylation epigenotypes of colorectal cancer more comprehensively.Experimental Design: To select new methylation markers on a genome-wide scale, we did methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis of colorectal cancer cell lines and re-expression array analysis by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine/Trichostatin A treatment. Methylation levels were analyzed quantitatively in 149 colorectal cancer samples using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization--time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Colorectal cancer was epigenotyped by unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering method.Results: Among 1,311 candidate silencing genes, 44 new markers were selected and underwent quantitative methylation analysis in colorectal cancer samples together with 16 previously reported markers. Colorectal cancer was clustered into high-, intermediate-, and low-methylation epigenotypes. Methylation markers were clustered into two major groups: group 1 showing methylation in high-methylation epigenotype, and group 2 showing methylation in high- and intermediate-methylation epigenotypes. A two-step marker panel deciding epigenotypes was developed with 95{\%} accuracy: the 1st panel consisting of three group-1 markers (CACNA1G, LOX, SLC30A10) to extract high-methylation epigenotype, and the 2nd panel consisting of four group-2 markers (ELMO1, FBN2, THBD, HAND1) and SLC30A10 again to divide the remains into intermediate- and low-methylation epigenotypes. The high-methylation epigenotype correlated significantly with MSI-high and BRAF-mutation(+) in concordance with reported CIMP. Intermediate-epigenotype significantly correlated with KRAS-mutation(+). KRAS-mutation(+) colorectal cancer with intermediate-methylation epigenotype showed significantly worse prognosis.Conclusions: Three methylation epigenotypes exist in colorectal cancer, and suitable classification markers have been developed. Intermediate-methylation epigenotype with KRAS-mutation(+) correlated with worse prognosis. Clin Cancer Res; 16(1); 21--33},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p?n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

@article{Peters:2019aa,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: A synoptic view of the human genome benefits chiefly from the application of nucleic acid sequencing and microarray technologies. These platforms allow interrogation of patterns such as gene expression and DNA methylation at the vast majority of canonical loci, allowing granular insights and opportunities for validation of original findings. However, problems arise when validating against a "gold standard" measurement, since this immediately biases all subsequent measurements towards that particular technology or protocol. Since all genomic measurements are estimates, in the absence of a "gold standard" we instead empirically assess the measurement precision and sensitivity of a large suite of genomic technologies via a consensus modelling method called the row-linear model. This method is an application of the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard E691 for assessing interlaboratory precision and sources of variability across multiple testing sites. Both cross-platform and cross-locus comparisons can be made across all common loci, allowing identification of technology- and locus-specific tendencies. RESULTS: We assess technologies including the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), two different RNA-Seq protocols (PolyA+ and Ribo-Zero) and five different gene expression array platforms. Each technology thus is characterised herein, relative to the consensus. We showcase a number of applications of the row-linear model, including correlation with known interfering traits. We demonstrate a clear effect of cross-hybridisation on the sensitivity of Infinium methylation arrays. Additionally, we perform a true interlaboratory test on a set of samples interrogated on the same platform across twenty-one separate testing laboratories. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A full implementation of the row-linear model, plus extra functions for visualisation, are found in the R package consensus at https://github.com/timpeters82/consensus.

	Abstract = {Background correction is an important preprocessing step for microarray data that attempts to adjust the data for the ambient intensity surrounding each feature. The "normexp" method models the observed pixel intensities as the sum of 2 random variables, one normally distributed and the other exponentially distributed, representing background noise and signal, respectively. Using a saddle-point approximation, Ritchie and others (2007) found normexp to be the best background correction method for 2-color microarray data. This article develops the normexp method further by improving the estimation of the parameters. A complete mathematical development is given of the normexp model and the associated saddle-point approximation. Some subtle numerical programming issues are solved which caused the original normexp method to fail occasionally when applied to unusual data sets. A practical and reliable algorithm is developed for exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using high-quality optimization software and using the saddle-point estimates as starting values. "MLE" is shown to outperform heuristic estimators proposed by other authors, both in terms of estimation accuracy and in terms of performance on real data. The saddle-point approximation is an adequate replacement in most practical situations. The performance of normexp for assessing differential expression is improved by adding a small offset to the corrected intensities.},

@article{Wen:2010aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Affymetrix GeneChip{\textregistered}system is a commonly used platform for microarray analysis but the technology is inherently expensive. Unfortunately, changes in experimental planning and execution, such as the unavailability of previously anticipated samples or a shift in research focus, may render significant numbers of pre-purchased GeneChip{\textregistered} microarrays unprocessed before their manufacturer's expiration dates. Researchers and microarray core facilities wonder whether expired microarrays are still useful for gene expression analysis. In addition, it was not clear whether the two human reference RNA samples established by the MAQC project in 2005 still maintained their transcriptome integrity over a period of four years. Experiments were conducted to answer these questions. RESULTS: Microarray data were generated in 2009 in three replicates for each of the two MAQC samples with either expired Affymetrix U133A or unexpired U133Plus2 microarrays. These results were compared with data obtained in 2005 on the U133Plus2 microarray. The percentage of overlap between the lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from U133Plus2 microarray data generated in 2009 and in 2005 was 97.44%. While there was some degree of fold change compression in the expired U133A microarrays, the percentage of overlap between the lists of DEGs from the expired and unexpired microarrays was as high as 96.99%. Moreover, the microarray data generated using the expired U133A microarrays in 2009 were highly concordant with microarray and TaqMan{\textregistered} data generated by the MAQC project in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that microarray data generated using U133A microarrays, which were more than four years past the manufacturer's expiration date, were highly specific and consistent with those from unexpired microarrays in identifying DEGs despite some appreciable fold change compression and decrease in sensitivity. Our data also suggested that the MAQC reference RNA samples, stored at -80$\,^{\circ}$C, were stable over a time frame of at least four years.},

@article{Mane:2009aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptome sequencing using next-generation sequencing platforms will soon be competing with DNA microarray technologies for global gene expression analysis. As a preliminary evaluation of these promising technologies, we performed deep sequencing of cDNA synthesized from the Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) reference RNA samples using Roche's 454 Genome Sequencer FLX. RESULTS: We generated more that 3.6 million sequence reads of average length 250 bp for the MAQC A and B samples and introduced a data analysis pipeline for translating cDNA read counts into gene expression levels. Using BLAST, 90{\%} of the reads mapped to the human genome and 64{\%} of the reads mapped to the RefSeq database of well annotated genes with e-values </= 10-20. We measured gene expression levels in the A and B samples by counting the numbers of reads that mapped to individual RefSeq genes in multiple sequencing runs to evaluate the MAQC quality metrics for reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy and compared the results with DNA microarrays and Quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR) from the MAQC studies. In addition, 88{\%} of the reads were successfully aligned directly to the human genome using the AceView alignment programs with an average 90{\%} sequence similarity to identify 137,899 unique exon junctions, including 22,193 new exon junctions not yet contained in the RefSeq database. CONCLUSION: Using the MAQC metrics for evaluating the performance of gene expression platforms, the ExpressSeq results for gene expression levels showed excellent reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity that improved systematically with increasing shotgun sequencing depth, and quantitative accuracy that was comparable to DNA microarrays and QRTPCR. In addition, a careful mapping of the reads to the genome using the AceView alignment programs shed new light on the complexity of the human transcriptome including the discovery of thousands of new splice variants.},

@article{Shippy:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We have assessed the utility of RNA titration samples for evaluating microarray platform performance and the impact of different normalization methods on the results obtained. As part of the MicroArray Quality Control project, we investigated the performance of five commercial microarray platforms using two independent RNA samples and two titration mixtures of these samples. Focusing on 12,091 genes common across all platforms, we determined the ability of each platform to detect the correct titration response across the samples. Global deviations from the response predicted by the titration ratios were observed. These differences could be explained by variations in relative amounts of messenger RNA as a fraction of total RNA between the two independent samples. Overall, both the qualitative and quantitative correspondence across platforms was high. In summary, titration samples may be regarded as a valuable tool, not only for assessing microarray platform performance and different analysis methods, but also for determining some underlying biological features of the samples.},

Many institutions have large archives of Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues that provide a unique opportunity for understanding genomic signatures of disease. However, genome-wide expression profiling of Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples have been challenging due to RNA degradation. Because of the significant heterogeneity in tissue quality, normalization and analysis of these data presents particular challenges. The distribution of intensity values from archival tissues are inherently noisy and skewed due to differential sample degradation raising two primary concerns; whether a highly skewed array will unduly influence initial normalization of the data and whether outlier arrays can be reliably identified.},

@article{Jiang:2011aa,
	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms.},

Here we assess technical performance with a proposed standard 'dashboard' of metrics derived from analysis of external spike-in RNA control ratio mixtures. These control ratio mixtures with defined abundance ratios enable assessment of diagnostic performance of differentially expressed transcript lists, limit of detection of ratio (LODR) estimates and expression ratio variability and measurement bias. The performance metrics suite is applicable to analysis of a typical experiment, and here we also apply these metrics to evaluate technical performance among laboratories. An interlaboratory study using identical samples shared among 12 laboratories with three different measurement processes demonstrates generally consistent diagnostic power across 11 laboratories. Ratio measurement variability and bias are also comparable among laboratories for the same measurement process. We observe different biases for measurement processes using different mRNA-enrichment protocols.},

RLE plots are particularly useful for assessing whether a procedure aimed at removing unwanted variation, i.e. a normalization procedure, has been successful. These plots, while originally devised for gene expression data from microarrays, can also be used to reveal unwanted variation in many other kinds of high dimensional data, where such variation can be problematic.},

There may be multiple competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, of which some may be study specific. We have developed "scone"- a flexible framework for assessing performance based on a comprehensive panel of data-driven metrics. Through graphical summaries and quantitative reports, scone summarizes trade-offs and ranks large numbers of normalization methods by panel performance. The method is implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R software package scone. We show that top-performing normalization methods lead to better agreement with independent validation data for a collection of scRNA-seq datasets. scone can be downloaded at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scone/.},

	Abstract = {The sequencing of the full transcriptome (RNA-seq) has become the preferred choice for the measurement of genome-wide gene expression. Despite its widespread use, challenges remain in RNA-seq data analysis. One often-overlooked aspect is normalization. Despite the fact that a variety of factors or `batch effects'can contribute unwanted variation to the data, commonly used RNA-seq normalization methods only correct for sequencing depth. The study of gene expression is particularly problematic when it is influenced simultaneously by a variety of biological factors in addition to the one of interest. Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show that batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that the choice of normalization method affects the power and reproducibility of the results. While commonly used global normalization methods are not able to adequately normalize the data, more recently developed RNA-seq normalization can. We focus on one particular method, RUVSeq and show that it is able to increase power and biological insight of the results. Finally, we provide a tutorial outlining the implementation of RUVSeq normalization that is applicable to a broad range of studies as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data.},

	Abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

Two subtypes of heart failure, ischemic heart disease (ISCH) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), have been studied using microarray platforms. However, microarray has limited resolution. Here we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify gene signatures for heart failure from six individuals, including three controls, one ISCH and two DCM patients. Using genes identified from this small RNA-Seq dataset, we were able to accurately classify heart failure status in a much larger set of 313 individuals. The identified genes significantly overlapped with genes identified via genome-wide association studies for cardiometabolic traits and the promoters of those genes were enriched for binding sites for transcriptions factors. Our results indicate that it is possible to use RNA-Seq to classify disease status for complex diseases such as heart failure using an extremely small training dataset.},

Here we use a comprehensive study design to generate Illumina RNA-seq and Affymetrix microarray data from the same liver samples of rats exposed in triplicate to varying degrees of perturbation by 27 chemicals representing multiple modes of action (MOAs). The cross-platform concordance in terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched pathways is linearly correlated with treatment effect size (R(2)0.8). Furthermore, the concordance is also affected by transcript abundance and biological complexity of the MOA. RNA-seq outperforms microarray (93{\%} versus 75{\%}) in DEG verification as assessed by quantitative PCR, with the gain mainly due to its improved accuracy for low-abundance transcripts. Nonetheless, classifiers to predict MOAs perform similarly when developed using data from either platform. Therefore, the endpoint studied and its biological complexity, transcript abundance and the genomic application are important factors in transcriptomic research and for clinical and regulatory decision making.},

@article{Zhao:2014aa,
	Abstract = {To demonstrate the benefits of RNA-Seq over microarray in transcriptome profiling, both RNA-Seq and microarray analyses were performed on RNA samples from a human T cell activation experiment. In contrast to other reports, our analyses focused on the difference, rather than similarity, between RNA-Seq and microarray technologies in transcriptome profiling. A comparison of data sets derived from RNA-Seq and Affymetrix platforms using the same set of samples showed a high correlation between gene expression profiles generated by the two platforms. However, it also demonstrated that RNA-Seq was superior in detecting low abundance transcripts, differentiating biologically critical isoforms, and allowing the identification of genetic variants. RNA-Seq also demonstrated a broader dynamic range than microarray, which allowed for the detection of more differentially expressed genes with higher fold-change. Analysis of the two datasets also showed the benefit derived from avoidance of technical issues inherent to microarray probe performance such as cross-hybridization, non-specific hybridization and limited detection range of individual probes. Because RNA-Seq does not rely on a pre-designed complement sequence detection probe, it is devoid of issues associated with probe redundancy and annotation, which simplified interpretation of the data. Despite the superior benefits of RNA-Seq, microarrays are still the more common choice of researchers when conducting transcriptional profiling experiments. This is likely because RNA-Seq sequencing technology is new to most researchers, more expensive than microarray, data storage is more challenging and analysis is more complex. We expect that once these barriers are overcome, the RNA-Seq platform will become the predominant tool for transcriptome analysis.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature.Results: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.Availability and implementation: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.Contact: shi{\char64}wehi.edu.au},

Rsubread is based on the successful Subread suite with the added ease-of-use of the R programming environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R object ready for downstream analysis. It integrates read mapping and quantification in a single package and has no software dependencies other than R itself. We demonstrate Rsubread's ability to detect exon-exon junctions de novo and to quantify expression at the level of either genes, exons or exon junctions. The resulting read counts can be input directly into a wide range of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor packages. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq as well as to counting functions in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment and counting algorithms. We show that Rsubread is faster and uses less memory than competitor tools and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values.},

@article{DellAnno:1998aa,
	Abstract = {In this study, we compared three methods for extraction and quantification of RNA and DNA from marine sediments: (i) a spectrophotometric method using the diphenylamine assay; (ii) a fluorometric method utilizing selective fluorochromes (thiazole orange for total nucleic acids and Hoechst 33258 for DNA); and (iii) a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method which uses a specific column to separate RNA and DNA and UV absorption of the nucleic acids for quantification. Sediment samples were collected in the oligotrophic Cretan Sea (eastern Mediterranean, from 40 to 1,540 m in depth) and compared to the distribution and composition of the benthic microbial assemblages (i.e., bacteria and microprotozoa). DNA concentrations measured spectrophotometrically and by HPLC were not significantly different, while fluorometric yields were significantly lower. Such differences appear mainly due to fact that the stain-DNA complex is strongly dependent on the DNA composition and structure. RNA concentrations determined by the three methods displayed some differences; fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods obtain RNA concentration by difference and therefore may be biased by DNA estimates. By contrast, the HPLC method provides independent assessments of RNA and DNA concentrations. We tentatively estimated the contribution of the detrital DNA to the total DNA pools in two ways. The two calculations provided quite similar results indicating that the majority of the DNA pool in the deep-sea sediments was detrital. Microbial RNA generally accounted for almost the entire sedimentary RNA pools below 100-m depth. RNA concentrations were found to decrease along the Cretan shelf and slope. The RNA/DNA ratio calculated by using fluorometric DNA concentrations was significantly correlated with values of sediment community oxygen consumption only below 100-m depth (dominated by the microbial biomass). These data suggest that the RNA/DNA ratio, based on fluorometric estimates of DNA, can be used as an indicator of benthic metabolic activity, but only when metazoan contribution to the microbial DNA is negligible.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}RNA and DNA concentrations were measured by a modification of the ethidium bromide method in batch cultures of marine phytoplankton and in natural plankton populations (1 to 333 μm) from Dabob Bay, Washington State, USA, in spring and summer of 1981. In the cultures the DNA/C ratio remained nearly constant during all phases of growth and growth rate was linearly related to the RNA/DNA ratio. The DNA/C ratio and the relationship between growth rate and RNA/DNA ratio for cultures was used to estimate the amount of living biomass and the growth rates for plankton populations of Dabob Bay. The amount of living carbon was never <57 {\%} of the total particulate carbon and average growth rates ranged from <0.3 divisions d⁻¹to >4 divisions d⁻¹. Some of the potential problems with such calculations, for example, occurrence of detrital DNA, variability in the DNA/C ratio for different groups of organisms, and differences in the relationship between growth rate and RNA/DNA ratio, are discussed. However, these problems may not be major obstacles to using DNA concentrations and RNA/DNA ratios for answering major questions in biological oceanography.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {Cancer cell stemness is essential for enabling malignant progression and clonal evolution. Cancer cell fate is likely determined by complex mechanisms involving both cell-intrinsic pathways and stress signals from tumor microenvironment. In this study, we examined the role of the tumor suppressor BRCA1 and hypoxia in the regulation of cancer cell stemness using genetically matched breast cancer cell lines. We have found that BRCA1, a multifunctional protein involved in DNA repair and epigenetic regulation, plays a critical role in the regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics. Reconstitution of BRCA1 resulted in significant decrease of the CSC-like populations in breast cancer cells whereas down-regulation of BRCA1 resulted in significant increase of the CSC-like populations. Furthermore, the BRCA1-reconstituted tumor cells are more sensitive to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-induced loss of stemness than the BRCA1-deficient cells are. Surprisingly, hypoxia preferentially blocks HDAC inhibitor-induced differentiation of the BRCA1-reconstituted breast cancer cells. In light of the increasing numbers of clinical trials involving HDAC inhibitors in human cancers, our observations strongly suggest that the BRCA1 status and tumor hypoxia should be considered as potentially important clinical parameters that may affect the therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {Neural activity has been suggested to initially trigger ATP production by glycolysis, rather than oxidative phosphorylation, for three reasons: glycolytic enzymes are associated with ion pumps; neurons may increase their energy supply by activating glycolysis in astrocytes to generate lactate; and activity increases glucose uptake more than O₂uptake. In rat hippocampal slices, neuronal activity rapidly decreased the levels of extracellular O₂and intracellular NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), even with lactate dehydrogenase blocked to prevent lactate generation, or with only 20{\%} superfused O₂to mimic physiological O₂levels. Pharmacological analysis revealed an energy budget in which 11{\%} of O₂use was on presynaptic action potentials, 17{\%} was on presynaptic Ca²⁺entry and transmitter release, 46{\%} was on postsynaptic glutamate receptors, and 26{\%} was on postsynaptic action potentials, in approximate accord with theoretical brain energy budgets. Thus, the major mechanisms mediating brain information processing are all initially powered by oxidative phosphorylation, and an astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle is not needed for this to occur.},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the design and low-level analysis of microarray experiments. Microarray experiments are used to quantify and compare gene expression on a large scale. Such experiments can be costly in terms of equipment, consumables, and time. Thus, careful design is important. Low-level analysis is carried out between the image analysis phase and interrogation of gene expression data. The goal of low-level analysis is to take raw data from the scanner, without any biological interpretation, and process it to produce cleaner and more meaningful gene expression measures. This is in contrast to higher level analysis, where questions of more biological nature are addressed. Such high-level questions include: detecting differential expression in treatment and control tissues, gene function, pathway analysis, and changes in gene expression over time. Improved low-level analysis aids the downstream data investigations. The chapter focuses on low-level analysis methods, such as (1) normalization that reduces or removes the sources of nonbiological variability (for both complementary DNA [cDNA] and Affymetrix arrays), (2) summarization, where one combines multiple probes to produce a gene expression measure (for Affymetrix-like arrays), (3) data quality (assessed by image analysis for cDNA arrays and from probe-level modeling of Affymetrix arrays), and (4) the detection of an absolute expression.},

	Abstract = {RNA biomarkers discovered by RT-PCR-based gene expression profiling of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue form the basis for widely used clinical diagnostic tests; however, RT-PCR is practically constrained in the number of transcripts that can be interrogated. We have developed and optimized RNA-Seq library chemistry as well as bioinformatics and biostatistical methods for whole transcriptome profiling from FFPE tissue. The chemistry accommodates low RNA inputs and sample multiplexing. These methods both enable rediscovery of RNA biomarkers for disease recurrence risk that were previously identified by RT-PCR analysis of a cohort of 136 patients, and also identify a high percentage of recurrence risk markers that were previously discovered using DNA microarrays in a separate cohort of patients, evidence that this RNA-Seq technology has sufficient precision and sensitivity for biomarker discovery. More than two thousand RNAs are strongly associated with breast cancer recurrence risk in the 136 patient cohort (FDR <10{\%}). Many of these are intronic RNAs for which corresponding exons are not also associated with disease recurrence. A number of the RNAs associated with recurrence risk belong to novel RNA networks. It will be important to test the validity of these novel associations in whole transcriptome RNA-Seq screens of other breast cancer cohorts.},

	N2 = {Pancreatic cancers are typically diagnosed at late stage where disease prognosis is poor as exemplified by a 5-year survival rate of 8.2{\%}. Earlier diagnosis would be beneficial by enabling surgical resection or earlier application of therapeutic regimens. We investigated the detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a non-invasive manner by interrogating changes in 5-hydroxymethylation cytosine status (5hmC) of circulating cell free DNA in the plasma of a PDAC cohort (n=51) in comparison with a non-cancer cohort (n=41). We found that 5hmC sites are enriched in a disease and stage specific manner in exons, 3'UTRs and transcription termination sites. Our data show that 5hmC density is reduced in promoters and histone H3K4me3-associated sites with progressive disease suggesting increased transcriptional activity. 5hmC density is differentially represented in thousands of genes, and a stringently filtered set of the most significant genes points to biology related to pancreas (GATA4, GATA6, PROX1, ONECUT1) and/or cancer development (YAP1, TEAD1, PROX1, ONECUT1, ONECUT2, IGF1 and IGF2). Regularized regression models were built using 5hmC densities in statistically filtered genes or a comprehensive set of highly variable 5hmC counts in genes and performed with an AUC = 0.94-0.96 on training data. We were able to test the ability to classify PDAC and non-cancer samples with the Elastic net and Lasso models on two external pancreatic cancer 5hmC data sets and found validation performance to be AUC = 0.74-0.97. The findings suggest that 5hmC changes enable classification of PDAC patients with high fidelity and are worthy of further investigation on larger cohorts of patient samples.},

	N2 = {Our study employed the detection of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) profiles on cell free DNA (cfDNA) from the plasma of cancer patients using a novel enrichment technology coupled with sequencing and machine learning based classification method. These classification methods were develo ped to detect the presence of disease in the plasma of cancer and control subjects. Cancer and control patient cfDNA cohorts were accrued from multiple sites consisting of 48 breast, 55 lung, 32 prostate and 53 pancreatic cancer subjects. In addition, a control cohort of 180 subjects (non-cancer) was employed to match cancer patient demographics (age, sex and smoking status) in a case-control study design. Logistic regression methods applied to each cancer case cohort individually, with a balancing non-cancer cohort, were able to classify cancer and control samples with measurably high performance. Measures of predictive performance by using 5-fold cross validation coupled with out-of-fold area under the curve (AUC) measures were established for breast, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer to be 0.89, 0.84, 0.95 and 0.83 respectively. The genes defining each of these predictive models were enriched for pathways relevant to disease specific etiology, notably in the control of gene regulation in these same pathways. The breast cancer cohort consisted primarily of stage I and II patients, including tumors \&lt; 2 cm and these samples exhibited a high cancer probability score. This suggests that the 5hmC derived classification methodology may yield epigenomic detection of early stage disease in plasma. Same observation was made for the pancreatic dataset where \&gt;50{\%} of cancers were stage I and II and showed the highest cancer probability score.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementno external fundsAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

@article{Roberts:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Gene expression profiling (GEP) has identified genes whose expression levels predict patient survival in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Such discovery techniques generally require frozen samples unavailable for most patients. We developed a quantitative nuclease protection assay to measure expression levels of prognostic DLBCL genes using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. FFPE tissue was sectioned, permeabilized, denatured in the presence of specific probes, and hybridized to mRNA in situ. Nuclease subsequently destroyed non-hybridized probe. Alkaline hydrolysis freed mRNA-bound probes from tissue, which were transferred to ArrayPlates for probe capture and chemiluminescent quantification. We validated assay performance using frozen, fresh, and FFPE DLBCL samples, then used 39 archived DLBCL, previously microarray analyzed, to correlate GEP and ArrayPlate results. We compared old (>18 years) with new (<2 months) paraffin blocks made from previously frozen tissue from the original biopsy. ArrayPlate gene expression results were confirmed with immunohistochemistry for BCL2, BCL6, and HLA-DR, showing agreement between mRNA species and the proteins they encode. Assay performance was linear to ∼1 mg sample/well. RNase and DNase treatments demonstrated assay specificity for RNA detection, both fixed and soluble RNA detection. Comparisons were excellent for lysate vs snap-frozen vs FFPE (R2>0.98 for all comparisons). Coefficients of variation for quadruplicates on FFPE were generally <20{\%}. Correlation between new and old paraffin blocks from the same biopsy was good (R2=0.71). Comparison of ArrayPlate to Affymetrix and cDNA microarrays showed reasonable correlations. Insufficient power from small sample size prevented successfully correlating results with patient survival, although hazard ratios trended the expected directions. We developed an assay to quantify expression levels of survival prediction genes in DLBCL using FFPE, fresh, or frozen tissue. While this technique cannot replace GEP for discovery, it indicates that expression differences identified by GEP can be replicated on a platform applicable to archived FFPE samples.},

@article{Grant:2011aa,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: A critical task in high-throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not been performed previously. RESULTS: We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM), performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability. AVAILABILITY: The RUM pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine (http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM).

	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA libraries constructed from cellular RNA complements (RNA-Seq) naturally provides a digital quantitative measurement for every expressed RNA molecule. Nature, impact and mutual interference of biases in different experimental setups are, however, still poorly understood-mostly due to the lack of data from intermediate protocol steps. We analysed multiple RNA-Seq experiments, involving different sample preparation protocols and sequencing platforms: we broke them down into their common--and currently indispensable--technical components (reverse transcription, fragmentation, adapter ligation, PCR amplification, gel segregation and sequencing), investigating how such different steps influence abundance and distribution of the sequenced reads. For each of those steps, we developed universally applicable models, which can be parameterised by empirical attributes of any experimental protocol. Our models are implemented in a computer simulation pipeline called the Flux Simulator, and we show that read distributions generated by different combinations of these models reproduce well corresponding evidence obtained from the corresponding experimental setups. We further demonstrate that our in silico RNA-Seq provides insights about hidden precursors that determine the final configuration of reads along gene bodies; enhancing or compensatory effects that explain apparently controversial observations can be observed. Moreover, our simulations identify hitherto unreported sources of systematic bias from RNA hydrolysis, a fragmentation technique currently employed by most RNA-Seq protocols.},

@article{Li:2011ab,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95{\%} credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing experiments, such as RNA-Seq, play an increasingly important role in biological research. One complication is that the power and accuracy of such experiments depend substantially on the number of reads sequenced, so it is important and challenging to determine the optimal read depth for an experiment or to verify whether one has adequate depth in an existing experiment. RESULTS: By randomly sampling lower depths from a sequencing experiment and determining where the saturation of power and accuracy occurs, one can determine what the most useful depth should be for future experiments, and furthermore, confirm whether an existing experiment had sufficient depth to justify its conclusions. We introduce the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each depth. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The subSeq R package is available at http://github.com/StoreyLab/subSeq/.},

@article{Benidt:2015aa,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA sequencing analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied in practice. Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been simulated according to the assumed model. This testing strategy can result in an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis method. RESULTS: We develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-seq data. The vector of read counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the user. We conduct simulation experiments based on the negative binomial distribution and our proposed nonparametric simulation algorithm. We compare performance between the two simulation experiments over a small subset of statistical methods for RNA-seq analysis available in the literature. We use as a benchmark the ability of a method to control the false discovery rate. Not surprisingly, methods based on parametric modeling assumptions seem to perform better with respect to false discovery rate control when data are simulated from parametric models rather than using our more realistic nonparametric simulation strategy.

The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed.

	Abstract = {The growth in popularity of RNA expression microarrays has been accompanied by concerns about the reliability of the data especially when comparing between different platforms. Here, we present an evaluation of the reproducibility of microarray results using two platforms, Affymetrix GeneChips and Illumina BeadArrays. The study design is based on a dilution series of two human tissues (blood and placenta), tested in duplicate on each platform. The results of a comparison between the platforms indicate very high agreement, particularly for genes which are predicted to be differentially expressed between the two tissues. Agreement was strongly correlated with the level of expression of a gene. Concordance was also improved when probes on the two platforms could be identified as being likely to target the same set of transcripts of a given gene. These results shed light on the causes or failures of agreement across microarray platforms. The set of probes we found to be most highly reproducible can be used by others to help increase confidence in analyses of other data sets using these platforms.},

Along with a growing richness  in the approaches there is a growing confusion among most scientists as to  how to make objective comparisons and choices between them for different  applications. There is a need for a standard framework for the microarray  community to compare and improve analytical and statistical methods. Results: We report on a microarray data set comprising 204 in-situ synthesized oligonucleotide arrays, each hybridized with two-color cDNA  samples derived from 20 different human tissues and cell lines. Design of  the ∼ 24 000 60mer oligonucleotides that report ∼2500 known genes on the arrays, and design of the hybridization experiments, were  carried out in a way that supports the performance assessment of alternative  data processing approaches and of alternative experiment and array designs.  We also propose standard figures of merit for success in detecting individual differential expression changes or expression levels, and for  detecting similarities and differences in expression patterns across genes  and experiments. We expect this data set and the proposed figures of merit  will provide a standard framework for much of the microarray community to  compare and improve many analytical and statistical methods relevant to microarray data analysis, including image processing, normalization, error  modeling, combining of multiple reporters per gene, use of replicate  experiments, and sample referencing schemes in measurements based on  expression change.Availability/Supplementary information: Expression data and supplementary information are available at http://www.rii.com/publications/2003/HE_SDS.htmContact: yudong_he@merck.com*To whom correspondence should be addressed.† A wholly owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.},

Because the number of competing preprocessing methods was large and growing we developed a benchmark to help users identify the best method for their application. A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures. At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted.Results: We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction, one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information regarding precision and accuracy.

This is a bonanza for the statistical geneticist, who can create probeset summaries with specific characteristics. There are now several methods available for summarizing probe level data from the popular Affymetrix GeneChips, but it is difficult to identify the best method for a given inquiry.Results: We have developed a graphical tool to evaluate summaries of Affymetrix probe level data. Plots and summary statistics offer a picture of how an expression measure performs in several important areas. This picture facilitates the comparison of competing expression measures and the selection of methods suitable for a specific investigation. The key is a benchmark data set consisting of a dilution study and a spike-in study. Because the truth is known for these data, we can identify statistical features of the data for which the expected outcome is known in advance.

@article{Li:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is increasing in incidence and resistance to treatment worldwide. The challenges in limited therapeutic options and poor survival outcomes in BC subtypes persist because of its molecular heterogeneity and resistance to standard endocrine therapy. Recently, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to identify biomarkers of disease progression and signaling pathways that could be amenable to specific therapies according to the BC subtype. However, there is no single generally accepted pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data in biomarker discovery due, in part, to the needs of simultaneously satisfying constraints of sensitivity and specificity. We proposed a combined approach using gene-wise normalization, UQ-pgQ2, followed by a Wald test from DESeq2. Our approach improved the analysis based on within-group comparisons in terms of the specificity when applied to publicly available RNA-seq BC datasets. In terms of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we combined an optimized log2 fold change cutoff with a nominal false discovery rate of 0.05 to further minimize false positives. Using this method in the analysis of two GEO BC datasets, we identified 797 DEGs uniquely expressed in triple negative BC (TNBC) and significantly associated with T cell and immune-related signaling, contributing to the immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. In contrast, we identified 1403 DEGs uniquely expressed in estrogen positive and HER2 negative BC (ER+HER2-BC) and significantly associated with eicosanoid, notching and FAK signaling while a common set of genes was associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, our approach to control for false positives identified two distinct gene expression profiles associated with these two subtypes of BC which are distinguishable by their molecular and functional attributes.},

This approach may yield associations without clinical relevance, false positive findings, or biased results due to ?fishing? for the desired results. To improve reproducibility, transparency, and validity among clinical trials, the National Institute of Health recently updated its grant application requirements, which mandates registration of clinical trials and submission of the original statistical analysis plan (SAP) along with the research protocol. Many leading journals also require the SAP as part of the submission package. The goal of this article and the companion article detailing the SAP of an actual research study is to provide a practical guide on writing an effective SAP. We describe the what, why, when, where, and who of a SAP, and highlight the key contents of the SAP.},

	Abstract = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover 3 main study designs: cohort, case--control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors, to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all 3 study designs and 4 are specific for cohort, case--control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available at http://www.annals.org and on the Web sites of PLoS Medicine and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

The Delphi survey was sent to statisticians in trial units who completed the survey of current practice (n = 46), CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) and SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guideline authors (n = 16), pharmaceutical industry statisticians (n = 3), journal editors (n = 9), and regulators (n = 2) (3 participants were included in 2 groups each), culminating in a consensus meeting attended by experts (N = 12) with representatives from each group. The guidance subsequently underwent critical review by statisticians from the surveyed trial units and members of the expert panel of the consensus meeting (N = 51), followed by piloting of the guidance document in the SAPs of 5 trials.No existing guidance was identified. The registered trials unit survey (46 responses) highlighted diversity in current practice and confirmed support for developing guidance. The Delphi survey (54 of 73, 74{\%} participants completing both rounds) reached consensus on 42{\%} (n = 46) of 110 items. The expert panel (N = 12) agreed that 63 items should be included in the guidance, with an additional 17 items identified as important but may be referenced elsewhere. Following critical review and piloting, some overlapping items were combined, leaving 55 items.Recommendations are provided for a minimum set of items that should be addressed and included in SAPs for clinical trials.

Liquid biopsy is a revolutionary technique that is opening previously unexpected perspectives. It consists of the detection and isolation of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes, as a source of genomic and proteomic information in patients with cancer. Many technical hurdles have been resolved thanks to newly developed techniques and next-generation sequencing analyses, allowing a broad application of liquid biopsy in a wide range of settings. Initially correlated to prognosis, liquid biopsy data are now being studied for cancer diagnosis, hopefully including screenings, and most importantly for the prediction of response or resistance to given treatments. In particular, the identification of specific mutations in target genes can aid in therapeutic decisions, both in the appropriateness of treatment and in the advanced identification of secondary resistance, aiming to early diagnose disease progression. Still application is far from reality but ongoing research is leading the way to a new era in oncology. This review summarizes the main techniques and applications of liquid biopsy in cancer.},

The inclusion of liquid biopsy in the management of NSCLC provides strong evidence on early treatment response, which becomes a basis for determining disease progression and the need for changes in treatment. Liquid biopsies can drive the decision making for treatment strategies to achieve better patient outcomes. Cell-free DNA and circulating tumor cells obtained from the blood are promising markers for determining patient status. They may improve cancer treatments, allow for better treatment control, enable early interventions, and change decision making from reactive actions toward more predictive early interventions.

	Abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to a significant reduction in sequencing cost with improved accuracy. In the area of liquid biopsy, NGS has been applied to sequence circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Since ctDNA is the DNA fragments released by tumor cells, it can provide a molecular profile of cancer. Liquid biopsy can be applied to all stages of cancer diagnosis and treatment, allowing non-invasive and real-time monitoring of disease development. The most promising aspects of liquid biopsy in cancer applications are cancer screening and early diagnosis because they can lead to better survival results and less disease burden. Although many ctDNA sequencing methods have enough sensitivity to detect extremely low levels of mutation frequency at the early stage of cancer, how to effectively implement them in population screening settings remains challenging. This paper focuses on the application of liquid biopsy in the early screening and diagnosis of cancer, introduces NGS-related methods, reviews recent progress, summarizes challenges, and discusses future research directions.},

Responses to targeted therapies have been observed in patients with actionable mutations detected in plasma DNA at variant allele fractions (VAFs) below 0.5{\%}. Highly sensitive methods are therefore required for optimal clinical use. To enable objective assessment of assay performance, detailed analytical validation is required. We developed the InVisionFirst{\texttrademark}assay, an assay based on enhanced tagged amplicon sequencing (eTAm-Seq{\texttrademark}) technology to profile 36 genes commonly mutated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancer types for actionable genomic alterations in cell-free DNA. The assay has been developed to detect point mutations, indels, amplifications and gene fusions that commonly occur in NSCLC. For analytical validation, two 10mL blood tubes were collected from NSCLC patients and healthy volunteer donors. In addition, contrived samples were used to represent a wide spectrum of genetic aberrations and VAFs. Samples were analyzed by multiple operators, at different times and using different reagent Lots. Results were compared with digital PCR (dPCR). The InVisionFirst assay demonstrated an excellent limit of detection, with 99.48{\%} sensitivity for SNVs present at VAF range 0.25{\%}-0.33{\%}, 92.46{\%} sensitivity for indels at 0.25{\%} VAF and a high rate of detection at lower frequencies while retaining high specificity (99.9997{\%} per base). The assay also detected ALK and ROS1 gene fusions, and DNA amplifications in ERBB2, FGFR1, MET and EGFR with high sensitivity and specificity. Comparison between the InVisionFirst assay and dPCR in a series of cancer patients showed high concordance. This analytical validation demonstrated that the InVisionFirst assay is highly sensitive, specific and robust, and meets analytical requirements for clinical applications.},

	N2 = {Purpose: RET is an emerging oncogenic target showing promise in phase I/II clinical trials. An understudied aspect of RET-driven cancers is the extent to which co-occurring genomic alterations exist and how they may impact prognosis or therapeutic response. Experimental Design: Somatic activating RET alterations were identified among 32,989 consecutive patients with metastatic solid tumors tested with a clinical cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA) assay. This comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay evaluates single nucleotide variants, and select indels, fusions, and copy number gains in 68-73 clinically-relevant cancer genes. Results: 176 somatic activating RET alterations were detected in 170 patients (143 fusions and 33 missense mutations). Patients had non-small cell lung (NSCLC, n=125), colorectal (n=15), breast (n=8), thyroid (n=8), or other cancers (n=14). Alterations in other oncogenic signaling pathway genes were frequently identified in RET-positive samples and varied by specific RET fusion gene partner. RET fusions involving partners other than KIF5B were enriched for alterations in MAPK pathway genes and other bona fide oncogenic drivers of NSCLC, particularly EGFR. Molecular and clinical data revealed that these variants emerged later in the genomic evolution of the tumor as mechanisms of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Conclusions: In the largest cancer cohort with somatic activating RET alterations, we describe novel co-occurrences of oncogenic signaling pathway aberrations. We find that KIF5B-RET fusions are highly specific for NSCLC. In our study, only non-KIF5B-RET fusions contributed to anti-EGFR therapy resistance. Knowledge of specific RET fusion gene partner may have clinical significance.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from the plasma of cancer patients (pts) has been shown to reflect the genomic mutation profile of the tumor. However, physician and patient assessment of clinical utility of these assays in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has not been previously described. METHODS: Patients were prospectively consented to a prospective genomic matching protocol (Assessment of Targeted Therapies Against Colorectal Cancer {$[$}ATTACC{$]$}), with collection of blood for cfDNA extraction and sequencing of a 54-gene panel in a CLIA-certified lab. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from prior resections or biopsies underwent 50-gene sequencing. Results from both assays were returned to the treating physicians for patient care and clinical trial selection. Follow-up surveys of treating physicians and chart reviews assessed clinical utility. RESULTS: 128 mCRC pts were enrolled between 6/2014 and 1/2015. Results were returned in median of 13 and 26 days for cfDNA and FFPE sequencing, respectively. With cfDNA sequencing, 78{\%} (100/128) of samples had a detectable somatic genomic alteration. 50{\%} of cfDNA cases had potentially actionable alterations, and 60{\%} of these could be genomically matched to at least one clinical trial in our institution. 50{\%} (15/30) of these pts enrolled onto an identified matched trial. Physicians reported that the cfDNA testing improved the quality of care they could provide in 73{\%} of the cases, and that 89{\%} of pts reported greater satisfaction with the efforts to personalize experimental therapeutic agents. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA sequencing can provide timely information on potentially actionable mutations and amplifications, thereby facilitating clinical trial enrollment and improving the perceived quality of care.},

@article{Campos-Fernandez:2019aa,
	Abstract = {Studies show that liquid biopsies are efficient in the detection of circulating cancer products. However, scientific community has not yet implemented this technology in routine clinical practice. Liquid biopsies are less invasive than traditional surgical ones because they rely on the detection of specific biomarkers in readily accessible body fluid samples. The clinical management of prostate cancer depends on the controversial blood serum biomarker PSA (prostate specific antigen). PSA tests have a low accuracy. In addition, a positive PSA result for prostate cancer needs a confirmation through a tissue biopsy. Thus, liquid biopsies are considered tools to find a surrogate biomarker. This review aimed to show the landscape of liquid biopsies in prostate cancer research to understand its challenges and foresee the trends in this area. We performed an exhaustive Pubmed search of articles reporting the study of liquid biopsies in prostate cancer with circulating tumor cells, cell-free nucleic acids and extracellular vesicles as targets. After a thorough analysis, we retrieved sixty-two relevant articles. Among the identified articles, the most used target and body fluid were circulating tumor cells and blood, respectively. Enumeration of circulating tumor cells was the most reported parameter, but it was often combined with other biomarkers. The most used methods for biomarker detection were those based on transcriptome analysis. Despite the vast literature about liquid biopsy in prostate cancer, most studies seem to be stuck on improving the yield of technologies. Consequently, they seem to test a limited number of samples. Larger cohorts could provide robust evidence to translate liquid biopsies of prostate cancer to the clinics.},

	Abstract = {Background: Real-time knowledge of the somatic genome can influence management of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). While routine metastatic tissue biopsy is challenging in mCRPC, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a minimally invasive tool to sample the tumor genome. However, no systematic comparisons of matched ``liquid'' and ``solid'' biopsies have been performed that would enable ctDNA profiling to replace the need for direct tissue sampling.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing across 72 clinically relevant genes in 45 plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples collected at time of metastatic tissue biopsy. We compared ctDNA alterations with exome sequencing data generated from matched tissue and quantified the concordance of mutations and copy number alterations using the Fisher exact test and Pearson correlations.Results: Seventy-five point six percent of cfDNA samples had a ctDNA proportion greater than 2% of total cfDNA. In these patients, all somatic mutations identified in matched metastatic tissue biopsies were concurrently present in ctDNA. Furthermore, the hierarchy of variant allele fractions for shared mutations was remarkably similar between ctDNA and tissue. Copy number profiles between matched liquid and solid biopsy were highly correlated, and individual copy number calls in clinically actionable genes were 88.9% concordant. Detected alterations included AR amplifications in 22 (64.7%) samples, SPOP mutations in three (8.8%) samples, and inactivating alterations in tumor suppressors TP53, PTEN, RB1, APC, CDKN1B, BRCA2, and PIK3R1. In several patients, ctDNA sequencing revealed robust changes not present in paired solid biopsy, including clinically relevant alterations in the AR, WNT, and PI3K pathways.Conclusions: Our study shows that, in the majority of patients, a ctDNA assay is sufficient to identify all driver DNA alterations present in matched metastatic tissue and supports development of DNA biomarkers to guide mCRPC patient management based on ctDNA alone.},

Fecal immunochemical test (FIT), FIT-DNA test and CEA assay are also in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests used in CRC screening. This meta-analysis aims to review the SEPT9 assay performance and compare it with other IVD CRC screening tests. By searching the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CBMdisc and CJFD database, 25 out of 180 studies were identified to report the SEPT9 assay performance. 2613 CRC cases and 6030 controls were included, and sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate its performance at various algorithms. 1/3 algorithm exhibited the best sensitivity while 2/3 and 1/1 algorithm exhibited the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. The performance of the blood SEPT9 assay is superior to that of the serum protein markers and the FIT test in symptomatic population, while appeared to be less potent than FIT and FIT-DNA tests in asymptomatic population. In conclusion, 1/3 algorithm is recommended for CRC screening, and 2/3 or 1/1 algorithms are suitable for early detection for diagnostic purpose.

@article{Wyatt:2017aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Real-time knowledge of the somatic genome can influence management of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). While routine metastatic tissue biopsy is challenging in mCRPC, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a minimally invasive tool to sample the tumor genome. However, no systematic comparisons of matched "liquid" and "solid" biopsies have been performed that would enable ctDNA profiling to replace the need for direct tissue sampling. METHODS: We performed targeted sequencing across 72 clinically relevant genes in 45 plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples collected at time of metastatic tissue biopsy. We compared ctDNA alterations with exome sequencing data generated from matched tissue and quantified the concordance of mutations and copy number alterations using the Fisher exact test and Pearson correlations. RESULTS: Seventy-five point six percent of cfDNA samples had a ctDNA proportion greater than 2{\%} of total cfDNA. In these patients, all somatic mutations identified in matched metastatic tissue biopsies were concurrently present in ctDNA. Furthermore, the hierarchy of variant allele fractions for shared mutations was remarkably similar between ctDNA and tissue. Copy number profiles between matched liquid and solid biopsy were highly correlated, and individual copy number calls in clinically actionable genes were 88.9{\%} concordant. Detected alterations included AR amplifications in 22 (64.7{\%}) samples, SPOP mutations in three (8.8{\%}) samples, and inactivating alterations in tumor suppressors TP53 , PTEN , RB1 , APC , CDKN1B , BRCA2 , and PIK3R1 . In several patients, ctDNA sequencing revealed robust changes not present in paired solid biopsy, including clinically relevant alterations in the AR, WNT, and PI3K pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, in the majority of patients, a ctDNA assay is sufficient to identify all driver DNA alterations present in matched metastatic tissue and supports development of DNA biomarkers to guide mCRPC patient management based on ctDNA alone.},

	Abstract = {There is a strong demand for the identification of new biomarkers in colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. Among all liquid biopsy analysts, cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) is probably the most promising tool with respect to the identification of minimal residual diseases, assessment of treatment response and prognosis, and identification of resistance mechanisms. Circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) maintains the same genomic signatures that are present in the matching tumor tissue allowing for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mutation burdens in body fluids. Thus, ctDNA-based research represents a non-invasive method for cancer detection. Among the numerous possible applications, the diagnostic, predictive, and/or prognostic utility of ctDNA in CRC has attracted intense research during the last few years. In the present review, we will describe the different aspects related to cfDNA research and evidence from studies supporting its potential use in CRC diagnoses and the improvement of therapy efficacy. We believe that ctDNA-based research should be considered as key towards the introduction of personalized medicine and patient benefits.},

	Abstract = {In cancer drug discovery, it is important to investigate the genetic determinants of response or resistance to cancer therapy as well as factors that contribute to adverse events in the course of clinical trials. Despite the emergence of new technologies and the ability to measure more diverse analytes (e.g., circulating tumor cell (CTC), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), etc.), tumor tissue is still the most common and reliable source for biomarker investigation. Because of its worldwide use and ability to preserve samples for many decades at ambient temperature, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (FFPE) is likely to be the preferred choice for tissue preservation in clinical practice for the foreseeable future. Multiple analyses are routinely performed on the same FFPE samples (such as Immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization, RNAseq, DNAseq, TILseq, Methyl-Seq, etc.). Thus, specimen prioritization and optimization of the isolation of analytes is critical to ensure successful completion of each assay. FFPE is notorious for producing suboptimal DNA quality and low DNA yield. However, commercial vendors tend to request higher DNA sample mass than what is actually required for downstream assays, which restricts the breadth of biomarker work that can be performed. We evaluated multiple genomics service laboratories to assess the current state of NGS pre-analytical processing of FFPE. Significant differences in pre-analytical capabilities were observed. Key aspects are highlighted and recommendations are made to improve the current practice in translational research.},

@article{Figueroa:2012aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target. METHODS: We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method. RESULTS: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning.},

Sample size and power calculation is required for applications for National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. Sample size and power calculation is well established for traditional biological studies such as mouse model, genome wide association study (GWAS), and microarray studies. Recent developments in high-throughput sequencing technology have allowed RNAseq to replace microarray as the technology of choice for high-throughput gene expression profiling. However, the sample size and power analysis of RNAseq technology is an underdeveloped area. Here, we present RNAseqPS, an advanced online RNAseq power and sample size calculation tool based on the Poisson and negative binomial distributions. RNAseqPS was built using the Shiny package in R. It provides an interactive graphical user interface that allows the users to easily conduct sample size and power analysis for RNAseq experimental design.

	Abstract = {Abstract Background: Given the high technical reproducibility and orders of magnitude greater resolution than microarrays, next-generation sequencing of mRNA (RNA-Seq) is quickly becoming the de facto standard for measuring levels of gene expression in biological experiments. Two important questions must be taken into consideration when designing a particular experiment, namely, 1) how deep does one need to sequence? and, 2) how many biological replicates are necessary to observe a significant change in expression? Results: Based on the gene expression distributions from 127 RNA-Seq experiments, we find evidence that 91{\%}?$\pm$?4{\%} of all annotated genes are sequenced at a frequency of 0.1 times per million bases mapped, regardless of sample source. Based on this observation, and combining this information with other parameters such as biological variation and technical variation that we empirically estimate from our large datasets, we developed a model to estimate the statistical power needed to identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq experiments. Conclusions: Our results provide a needed reference for ensuring RNA-Seq gene expression studies are conducted with the optimally sample size, power, and sequencing depth. We also make available both R code and an Excel worksheet for investigators to calculate for their own experiments.},

Two important questions must be taken into consideration when designing a particular experiment, namely, 1) how deep does one need to sequence? and, 2) how many biological replicates are necessary to observe a significant change in expression? Results: Based on the gene expression distributions from 127 RNA-Seq experiments, we find evidence that 91{\%}?$\pm$?4{\%} of all annotated genes are sequenced at a frequency of 0.1 times per million bases mapped, regardless of sample source. Based on this observation, and combining this information with other parameters such as biological variation and technical variation that we empirically estimate from our large datasets, we developed a model to estimate the statistical power needed to identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq experiments. Conclusions: Our results provide a needed reference for ensuring RNA-Seq gene expression studies are conducted with the optimally sample size, power, and sequencing depth. We also make available both R code and an Excel worksheet for investigators to calculate for their own experiments.},

To evaluate feasibility and provide guidance, we evaluated RNA-seq sample size tools identified from a systematic search. The focus was on whether real pilot data would be needed for reliable results and on identifying tools that would perform well in scenarios with different levels of biological heterogeneity and fold changes (FCs) between conditions. We used simulations based on real data for tool evaluation. In all settings, the six evaluated tools provided widely different answers, which were strongly affected by FC. Although all tools failed for small FCs, some tools can at least be recommended when closely matching pilot data are available and relatively large FCs are anticipated.},

@article{Zhao:2018ab,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most important and often neglected components of a successful RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiment is sample size estimation. A few negative binomial model-based methods have been developed to estimate sample size based on the parameters of a single gene. However, thousands of genes are quantified and tested for differential expression simultaneously in RNA-Seq experiments. Thus, additional issues should be carefully addressed, including the false discovery rate for multiple statistic tests, widely distributed read counts and dispersions for different genes. RESULTS: To solve these issues, we developed a sample size and power estimation method named RnaSeqSampleSize, based on the distributions of gene average read counts and dispersions estimated from real RNA-seq data. Datasets from previous, similar experiments such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) can be used as a point of reference. Read counts and their dispersions were estimated from the reference's distribution; using that information, we estimated and summarized the power and sample size. RnaSeqSampleSize is implemented in R language and can be installed from Bioconductor website. A user friendly web graphic interface is provided at http://cqs.mc.vanderbilt.edu/shiny/RnaSeqSampleSize/ . CONCLUSIONS: RnaSeqSampleSize provides a convenient and powerful way for power and sample size estimation for an RNAseq experiment. It is also equipped with several unique features, including estimation for interested genes or pathway, power curve visualization, and parameter optimization.},

@article{Bi:2016aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments have been popularly applied to transcriptome studies in recent years. Such experiments are still relatively costly. As a result, RNA-seq experiments often employ a small number of replicates. Power analysis and sample size calculation are challenging in the context of differential expression analysis with RNA-seq data. One challenge is that there are no closed-form formulae to calculate power for the popularly applied tests for differential expression analysis. In addition, false discovery rate (FDR), instead of family-wise type I error rate, is controlled for the multiple testing error in RNA-seq data analysis. So far, there are very few proposals on sample size calculation for RNA-seq experiments. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a procedure for sample size calculation while controlling FDR for RNA-seq experimental design. Our procedure is based on the weighted linear model analysis facilitated by the voom method which has been shown to have competitive performance in terms of power and FDR control for RNA-seq differential expression analysis. We derive a method that approximates the average power across the differentially expressed genes, and then calculate the sample size to achieve a desired average power while controlling FDR. Simulation results demonstrate that the actual power of several popularly applied tests for differential expression is achieved and is close to the desired power for RNA-seq data with sample size calculated based on our method. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method provides an efficient algorithm to calculate sample size while controlling FDR for RNA-seq experimental design. We also provide an R package ssizeRNA that implements our proposed method and can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ( http://cran.r-project.org ).},

@article{Baccarella:2018aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Sequencing analysis methods are rapidly evolving, and the tool choice for each step of one common workflow, differential expression analysis, which includes read alignment, expression modeling, and differentially expressed gene identification, has a dramatic impact on performance characteristics. Although a number of workflows are emerging as high performers that are robust to diverse input types, the relative performance characteristics of these workflows when either read depth or sample number is limited-a common occurrence in real-world practice-remain unexplored. RESULTS: Here, we evaluate the impact of varying read depth and sample number on the performance of differential gene expression identification workflows, as measured by precision, or the fraction of genes correctly identified as differentially expressed, and by recall, or the fraction of differentially expressed genes identified. We focus our analysis on 30 high-performing workflows, systematically varying the read depth and number of biological replicates of patient monocyte samples provided as input. We find that, in general for most workflows, read depth has little effect on workflow performance when held above two million reads per sample, with reduced workflow performance below this threshold. The greatest impact of decreased sample number is seen below seven samples per group, when more heterogeneity in workflow performance is observed. The choice of differential expression identification tool, in particular, has a large impact on the response to limited inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Among the tested workflows, the recall/precision balance remains relatively stable at a range of read depths and sample numbers, although some workflows are more sensitive to input restriction. At ranges typically recommended for biological studies, performance is more greatly impacted by the number of biological replicates than by read depth. Caution should be used when selecting analysis workflows and interpreting results from low sample number experiments, as all workflows exhibit poorer performance at lower sample numbers near typically reported values, with variable impact on recall versus precision. These analyses highlight the performance characteristics of common differential gene expression workflows at varying read depths and sample numbers, and provide empirical guidance in experimental and analytical design.},

The DNA methylation inhibitors decitabine and azacitidine are efficacious for hematological neoplasms at lower, less toxic, doses. Experimentally, high doses induce rapid DNA damage and cytotoxicity, which do not explain the prolonged time to response observed in patients. We show that transient exposure of cultured and primary leukemic and epithelial tumor cells to clinically relevant nanomolar doses, without causing immediate cytotoxicity, produce an antitumor "memory" response, including inhibition of subpopulations of cancer stem-like cells. These effects are accompanied by sustained decreases in genomewide promoter DNA methylation, gene reexpression, and antitumor changes in key cellular regulatory pathways. Low-dose decitabine and azacitidine may have broad applicability for cancer management.},

@article{Liu:2016ab,
	Abstract = {Vitamin C deficiency is found in patients with cancer and might complicate various therapy paradigms. Here we show how this deficiency may influence the use of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) for treatment of hematological neoplasias. In vitro, when vitamin C is added at physiological levels to low doses of the DNMTi 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), there is a synergistic inhibition of cancer-cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. These effects are associated with enhanced immune signals including increased expression of bidirectionally transcribed endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcripts, increased cytosolic dsRNA, and activation of an IFN-inducing cellular response. This synergistic effect is likely the result of both passive DNA demethylation by DNMTi and active conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes at LTR regions of ERVs, because vitamin C acts as a cofactor for TET proteins. In addition, TET2 knockout reduces the synergy between the two compounds. Furthermore, we show that many patients with hematological neoplasia are markedly vitamin C deficient. Thus, our data suggest that correction of vitamin C deficiency in patients with hematological and other cancers may improve responses to epigenetic therapy with DNMTis.},

@article{Hollenbach:2010aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cytidine nucleoside analogs azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) are used for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Few non-clinical studies have directly compared the mechanisms of action of these agents in a head-to-head fashion, and the agents are often viewed as mechanistically similar DNA hypomethylating agents. To better understand the similarities and differences in mechanisms of these drugs, we compared their in vitro effects on several end points in human AML cell lines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both drugs effected DNA methyltransferase 1 depletion, DNA hypomethylation, and DNA damage induction, with DAC showing equivalent activity at concentrations 2- to 10-fold lower than AZA. At concentrations above 1 microM, AZA had a greater effect than DAC on reducing cell viability. Both drugs increased the sub-G1 fraction and apoptosis markers, with AZA decreasing all cell cycle phases and DAC causing an increase in G2-M. Total protein synthesis was reduced only by AZA, and drug-modulated gene expression profiles were largely non-overlapping. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate shared mechanisms of action of AZA and DAC on DNA-mediated markers of activity, but distinctly different effects in their actions on cell viability, protein synthesis, cell cycle, and gene expression. The differential effects of AZA may be mediated by RNA incorporation, as the distribution of AZA in nucleic acid of KG-1a cells was 65:35, RNA:DNA.},

	Abstract = {Non-genetic drug resistance is increasingly recognised in various cancers. Molecular insights into this process are lacking and it is unknown whether stable non-genetic resistance can be overcome. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of paired drug na{\"\i}ve and resistant AML patient samples and cellular barcoding in a unique mouse model of non-genetic resistance, here we demonstrate that transcriptional plasticity drives stable epigenetic resistance. With a CRISPR-Cas9 screen we identify regulators of enhancer function as important modulators of the resistant cell state. We show that inhibition of Lsd1 (Kdm1a) is able to overcome stable epigenetic resistance by facilitating the binding of the pioneer factor, Pu.1 and cofactor, Irf8, to nucleate new enhancers that regulate the expression of key survival genes. This enhancer switching results in the re-distribution of transcriptional co-activators, including Brd4, and provides the opportunity to disable their activity and overcome epigenetic resistance. Together these findings highlight key principles to help counteract non-genetic drug resistance.},

	Abstract = {We propose eight data transformations (r, r2, rv, rv2, l, l2, lv, and lv2) for RNA-seq data analysis aiming to make the transformed sample mean to be representative of the distribution center since it is not always possible to transform count data to satisfy the normality assumption. Simulation studies showed that for data sets with small (e.g., nCases = nControls = 3) or large sample size (e.g., nCases = nControls = 100) limma based on data from the l, l2, and r2 transformations performed better than limma based on data from the voom transformation in term of accuracy, FDR, and FNR. For datasets with moderate sample size (e.g., nCases = nControls = 30 or 50), limma with the rv and rv2 transformations performed similarly to limma with the voom transformation. Real data analysis results are consistent with simulation analysis results: limma with the r, l, r2, and l2 transformation performed better than limma with the voom transformation when sample sizes are small or large; limma with the rv and rv2 transformations performed similarly to limma with the voom transformation when sample sizes are moderate. We also observed from our data analyses that for datasets with large sample size, the gene-selection via the Wilcoxon rank sum test (a non-parametric two sample test method) based on the raw data outperformed limma based on the transformed data.},

	Abstract = {Pregnant women carry a mixture of cell-free DNA fragments from self and fetus (non-self) in their circulation. In recent years multiple independent studies have demonstrated the ability to detect fetal trisomies such as trisomy 21, the cause of Down syndrome, by Next-Generation Sequencing of maternal plasma. The current clinical tests based on this approach show very high sensitivity and specificity, although as yet they have not become the standard diagnostic test. Here we describe improvements to the analysis of the sequencing data by reducing GC bias and better handling of the genomic repeats. We show substantial improvements in the sensitivity of the standard trisomy 21 statistical tests, which we measure by artificially reducing read coverage. We also explore the bias stemming from the natural cleavage of plasma DNA by examining DNA motifs and position specific base distributions. We propose a model to correct this fragmentation bias and observe that incorporating this bias does not lead to any further improvements in the detection of fetal trisomy. The improved bias corrections that we demonstrate in this work can be readily adopted into existing fetal trisomy detection protocols and should also lead to improvements in sub-chromosomal copy number variation detection.},

	Abstract = {We find that current computational methods for estimating transcript abundance from RNA-seq data can lead to hundreds of false-positive results. We show that these systematic errors stem largely from a failure to model fragment GC content bias. Sample-specific biases associated with fragment sequence features lead to misidentification of transcript isoforms. We introduce alpine, a method for estimating sample-specific bias-corrected transcript abundance. By incorporating fragment sequence features, alpine greatly increases the accuracy of transcript abundance estimates, enabling a fourfold reduction in the number of false positives for reported changes in expression compared with Cufflinks. Using simulated data, we also show that alpine retains the ability to discover true positives, similar to other approaches. The method is available as an R/Bioconductor package that includes data visualization tools useful for bias discovery.},

@article{Benjamini:2012aa,
	Abstract = {GC content bias describes the dependence between fragment count (read coverage) and GC content found in Illumina sequencing data. This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},

	Abstract = {Estimates of biological age based on DNA methylation patterns, often referred to as "epigenetic age", "DNAm age", have been shown to be robust biomarkers of age in humans. We previously demonstrated that independent of chronological age, epigenetic age assessed in blood predicted all-cause mortality in four human cohorts. Here, we expanded our original observation to 13 different cohorts for a total sample size of 13,089 individuals, including three racial/ethnic groups. In addition, we examined whether incorporating information on blood cell composition into the epigenetic age metrics improves their predictive power for mortality. All considered measures of epigenetic age acceleration were predictive of mortality (p≤8.2x10(-9)), independent of chronological age, even after adjusting for additional risk factors (p<5.4x10(-4)), and within the racial/ethnic groups that we examined (non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, African Americans). Epigenetic age estimates that incorporated information on blood cell composition led to the smallest p-values for time to death (p=7.5x10(-43)). Overall, this study a) strengthens the evidence that epigenetic age predicts all-cause mortality above and beyond chronological age and traditional risk factors, and b) demonstrates that epigenetic age estimates that incorporate information on blood cell counts lead to highly significant associations with all-cause mortality.},

	Abstract = {The use of liquid biopsies for cancer detection and management is rapidly gaining prominence1. Current methods for the detection of circulating tumour DNA involve sequencing somatic mutations using cell-free DNA, but the sensitivity of these methods may be low among patients with early-stage cancer given the limited number of recurrent mutations2--5. By contrast, large-scale epigenetic alterations---which are tissue- and cancer-type specific---are not similarly constrained6 and therefore potentially have greater ability to detect and classify cancers in patients with early-stage disease. Here we develop a sensitive, immunoprecipitation-based protocol to analyse the methylome of small quantities of circulating cell-free DNA, and demonstrate the ability to detect large-scale DNA methylation changes that are enriched for tumour-specific patterns. We also demonstrate robust performance in cancer detection and classification across an extensive collection of plasma samples from several tumour types. This work sets the stage to establish biomarkers for the minimally invasive detection, interception and classification of early-stage cancers based on plasma cell-free DNA methylation patterns.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) contributes to PCa initiation and metastatic progression. To comprehensively define the cancer-associated changes in miRNA targeting and function in commonly studied models of PCa, we performed photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation of the Argonaute protein in a panel of PCa cell lines modeling different stages of PCa progression. Using this comprehensive catalogue of miRNA targets, we analyzed miRNA targeting on known drivers of PCa and examined tissue-specific and stage-specific pathway targeting by miRNAs. We found that androgen receptor is the most frequently targeted PCa oncogene and that miR-148a targets the largest number of known PCa drivers. Globally, tissue-specific and stage-specific changes in miRNA targeting are driven by homeostatic response to active oncogenic pathways. Our findings indicate that, even in advanced PCa, the miRNA pool adapts to regulate continuing alterations in the cancer genome to balance oncogenic molecular changes. These findings are important because they are the first to globally characterize miRNA changes in PCa and demonstrate how the miRNA target spectrum responds to staged tumorigenesis.},

@article{Holloway:2006aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns are often raised about the accuracy of microarray technologies and the degree of cross-platform agreement, but there are yet no methods which can unambiguously evaluate precision and sensitivity for these technologies on a whole-array basis. RESULTS: A methodology is described for evaluating the precision and sensitivity of whole-genome gene expression technologies such as microarrays. The method consists of an easy-to-construct titration series of RNA samples and an associated statistical analysis using non-linear regression. The method evaluates the precision and responsiveness of each microarray platform on a whole-array basis, i.e., using all the probes, without the need to match probes across platforms. An experiment is conducted to assess and compare four widely used microarray platforms. All four platforms are shown to have satisfactory precision but the commercial platforms are superior for resolving differential expression for genes at lower expression levels. The effective precision of the two-color platforms is improved by allowing for probe-specific dye-effects in the statistical model. The methodology is used to compare three data extraction algorithms for the Affymetrix platforms, demonstrating poor performance for the commonly used proprietary algorithm relative to the other algorithms. For probes which can be matched across platforms, the cross-platform variability is decomposed into within-platform and between-platform components, showing that platform disagreement is almost entirely systematic rather than due to measurement variability. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate good precision and sensitivity for all the platforms, but highlight the need for improved probe annotation. They quantify the extent to which cross-platform measures can be expected to be less accurate than within-platform comparisons for predicting disease progression or outcome.},

Experimentally, researchers face a difficult choice whether to profile heterogeneous samples with the ensuing confounding effects, or a priori focus on a few cell subsets of interest, potentially limiting new discoveries. An attractive alternative solution is to extract cell subset-specific information directly from heterogeneous samples via computational deconvolution techniques, thereby capturing both cell-centered and whole system level context. Such approaches are capable of unraveling novel biology, undetectable otherwise. Here we review the present state of available deconvolution techniques, their advantages and limitations, with a focus on blood expression data and immunological studies in general.},

While TILs are well known to play important roles in many aspects of cancer biology, recent developments in immuno-oncology have spurred considerable interest in TILs, particularly in relation to their optimal engagement by emerging immunotherapies. Traditionally, the enumeration of TIL phenotypic diversity and composition in solid tumors has relied on resolving single cells by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical methods. However, advances in genome-wide technologies and computational methods are now allowing TILs to be profiled with increasingly high resolution and accuracy directly from RNA mixtures of bulk tumor samples. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the development of in silico tumor dissection methods, and illustrate examples of how these strategies can be applied to characterize TILs in human tumors to facilitate personalized cancer therapy.},

	N2 = {Summary: Gene expression data are typically generated from heterogeneous biological samples that are composed of multiple cell or tissue types, in varying proportions, each contributing to global gene expression. This heterogeneity is a major confounder in standard analysis such as differential expression analysis, where differences in the relative proportions of the constituent cells may prevent or bias the detection of cell-specific differences. Computational deconvolution of global gene expression is an appealing alternative to costly physical sample separation techniques and enables a more detailed analysis of the underlying biological processes at the cell-type level. To facilitate and popularize the application of such methods, we developed CellMix, an R package that incorporates most state-of-the-art deconvolution methods, into an intuitive and extendible framework, providing a single entry point to explore, assess and disentangle gene expression data from heterogeneous samples.Availability and Implementation: The CellMix package builds on R/BioConductor and is available from http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/∼renaud/CRAN/web/CellMix.

@article{Ahn:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Tissue samples of tumor cells mixed with stromal cells cause underdetection of gene expression signatures associated with cancer prognosis or response to treatment. In silico dissection of mixed cell samples is essential for analyzing expression data generated in cancer studies. Currently, a systematic approach is lacking to address three challenges in computational deconvolution: (i) violation of linear addition of expression levels from multiple tissues when log-transformed microarray data are used; (ii) estimation of both tumor proportion and tumor-specific expression, when neither is known a priori; and (iii) estimation of expression profiles for individual patients. Results: We have developed a statistical method for deconvolving mixed cancer transcriptomes, DeMix, which addresses the aforementioned issues in array-based expression data. We demonstrate the performance of our model in synthetic and real, publicly available, datasets. DeMix can be applied to ongoing biomarker-based clinical studies and to the vast expression datasets previously generated from mixed tumor and stromal cell samples. Availability: All codes are written in C and integrated into an R function, which is available at http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/∼wwang7/DeMix.html.

	Abstract = {Tissues are complex milieus consisting of numerous cell types. Several recent methods have attempted to enumerate cell subsets from transcriptomes. However, the available methods have used limited sources for training and give only a partial portrayal of the full cellular landscape. Here we present xCell, a novel gene signature-based method, and use it to infer 64 immune and stromal cell types. We harmonized 1822 pure human cell type transcriptomes from various sources and employed a curve fitting approach for linear comparison of cell types and introduced a novel spillover compensation technique for separating them. Using extensive in silico analyses and comparison to cytometry immunophenotyping, we show that xCell outperforms other methods. xCell is available at http://xCell.ucsf.edu/.

	Abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling has revolutionized biomedical research; vast amounts of expression data from numerous studies of many diseases are now available. Making the best use of this resource in order to better understand disease processes and treatment remains an open challenge. In particular, disease biomarkers detected in case--control studies suffer from low reliability and are only weakly reproducible. Here, we present a systematic integrative analysis methodology to overcome these shortcomings. We assembled and manually curated more than 14 000 expression profiles spanning 48 diseases and 18 expression platforms. We show that when studying a particular disease, judicious utilization of profiles from other diseases and information on disease hierarchy improves classification quality, avoids overoptimistic evaluation of that quality, and enhances disease-specific biomarker discovery. This approach yielded specific biomarkers for 24 of the analyzed diseases. We demonstrate how to combine these biomarkers with large-scale interaction, mutation and drug target data, forming a highly valuable disease summary that suggests novel directions in disease understanding and drug repurposing. Our analysis also estimates the number of samples required to reach a desired level of biomarker stability. This methodology can greatly improve the exploitation of the mountain of expression profiles for better disease analysis.},

	Abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we analyzed mRNA expression levels corresponding to 12,600 transcript sequences in 186 lung tumor samples, including 139 adenocarcinomas resected from the lung. Hierarchical and probabilistic clustering of expression data defined distinct subclasses of lung adenocarcinoma. Among these were tumors with high relative expression of neuroendocrine genes and of type II pneumocyte genes, respectively. Retrospective analysis revealed a less favorable outcome for the adenocarcinomas with neuroendocrine gene expression. The diagnostic potential of expression profiling is emphasized by its ability to discriminate primary lung adenocarcinomas from metastases of extra-pulmonary origin. These results suggest that integration of expression profile data with clinical parameters could aid in diagnosis of lung cancer patients.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale molecular profiling technologies have assisted the identification of disease biomarkers and facilitated the basic understanding of cellular processes. However, samples collected from human subjects in clinical trials possess a level of complexity, arising from multiple cell types, that can obfuscate the analysis of data derived from them. Failure to identify, quantify, and incorporate sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on subsequent statistical studies. We describe an approach that builds upon a linear latent variable model, in which expression levels from mixed cell populations are modeled as the weighted average of expression from different cell types. We solve these equations using quadratic programming, which efficiently identifies the globally optimal solution while preserving non-negativity of the fraction of the cells. We applied our method to various existing platforms to estimate proportions of different pure cell or tissue types and gene expression profilings of distinct phenotypes, with a focus on complex samples collected in clinical trials. We tested our methods on several well controlled benchmark data sets with known mixing fractions of pure cell or tissue types and mRNA expression profiling data from samples collected in a clinical trial. Accurate agreement between predicted and actual mixing fractions was observed. In addition, our method was able to predict mixing fractions for more than ten species of circulating cells and to provide accurate estimates for relatively rare cell types (<10{\%} total population). Furthermore, accurate changes in leukocyte trafficking associated with Fingolomid (FTY720) treatment were identified that were consistent with previous results generated by both cell counts and flow cytometry. These data suggest that our method can solve one of the open questions regarding the analysis of complex transcriptional data: namely, how to identify the optimal mixing fractions in a given experiment.},

	N2 = {Summary: For heterogeneous tissues, measurements of gene expression through mRNA-Seq data are confounded by relative proportions of cell types involved. In this note, we introduce an efficient pipeline: DeconRNASeq, an R package for deconvolution of heterogeneous tissues based on mRNA-Seq data. It adopts a globally optimized non-negative decomposition algorithm through quadratic programming for estimating the mixing proportions of distinctive tissue types in next-generation sequencing data. We demonstrated the feasibility and validity of DeconRNASeq across a range of mixing levels and sources using mRNA-Seq data mixed in silico at known concentrations. We validated our computational approach for various benchmark data, with high correlation between our predicted cell proportions and the real fractions of tissues. Our study provides a rigorous, quantitative and high-resolution tool as a prerequisite to use mRNA-Seq data. The modularity of package design allows an easy deployment of custom analytical pipelines for data from other high-throughput platforms.Availability: DeconRNASeq is written in R, and is freely available at http://bioconductor.org/packages.Contact:tinggong{\char64}gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying adverse birth outcomes following prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke remain unknown due, in part, to the absence or unreliability of information regarding maternal cigarette smoke exposure during pregnancy. Our goal was to determine if placental cotinine could be a reliable biomarker of fetal cigarette smoke exposure during pregnancy. Cotinine levels were determined in placentas from 47 women who reported smoking during pregnancy and from 10 women who denied cigarette smoke exposure. Cotinine levels were significantly higher in placentas from women reporting cigarette smoking (median = 27.2 ng/g) versus women who reported no smoke exposure (2.3 ng/g, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified an optimal cut point of 7.5 ng/g (sensitivity = 78.7{\%}, specificity = 100{\%}) to classify placenta samples from mothers who smoked versus those from mothers who did not. Among 415 placentas for which maternal cigarette smoking status was unavailable, 167 had cotinine levels > 7.5 ng/g and would be considered positive for cigarette smoke exposure. Data from quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that in utero cigarette smoke exposure predicted by cotinine in placenta is associated with changes in the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in fetal tissues. CYP1A1 mRNA in fetal lung and liver tissue and CYP1B1 mRNA in fetal lung tissue were significantly induced when cotinine was detected in placenta. These findings indicate that cotinine in placenta is a reliable biomarker for fetal exposure and response to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Use high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) to identify metabolic pathways and networks associated with tobacco use in military personnel. METHODS: Four hundred de-identified samples obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository were classified as tobacco users or non-users according to cotinine content. HRM and bioinformatic methods were used to determine pathways and networks associated with classification. RESULTS: Eighty individuals were classified as tobacco users compared to 320 non-users based on cotinine levels ≥10 ng/mL. Alterations in lipid and xenobiotic metabolism, and diverse effects on amino acid, sialic acid and purine and pyrimidine metabolism were observed. Importantly, network analysis showed broad effects on metabolic associations not simply linked to well-defined pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco use has complex metabolic effects which must be considered in evaluation of deployment-associated environmental exposures in military personnel.},

	Abstract = {Capturing the effects of exposure in a specific target organ is a major challenge in risk assessment. Exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) implicates the field of tissue injury in the lung as well as nasal and airway epithelia. Xenobiotic metabolism in particular becomes an attractive tool for chemical risk assessment because of its responsiveness against toxic compounds, including those present in CS. This study describes an efficient integration from transcriptomic data to quantitative measures, which reflect the responses against xenobiotics that are captured in a biological network model. We show here that our novel systems approach can quantify the perturbation in the network model of xenobiotic metabolism. We further show that this approach efficiently compares the perturbation upon CS exposure in bronchial and nasal epithelial cells in vivo samples obtained from smokers. Our observation suggests the xenobiotic responses in the bronchial and nasal epithelial cells of smokers were similar to those observed in their respective organotypic models exposed to CS. Furthermore, the results suggest that nasal tissue is a reliable surrogate to measure xenobiotic responses in bronchial tissue.},

	Abstract = {Tobacco smoke exposure dramatically alters DNA methylation in blood cells and may mediate smoking-associated complex diseases through effects on immune cell function. However, knowledge of smoking effects in specific leukocyte subtypes is limited. To better characterize smoking--associated methylation changes in whole blood and leukocyte subtypes, we used Illumina 450K arrays and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to assess genome-wide DNA methylation. Differential methylation analysis in whole blood DNA from 172 smokers and 81 nonsmokers revealed 738 CpGs, including 616 previously unreported CpGs, genome-wide significantly associated with current smoking (p <1.2x10(-7), Bonferroni correction). Several CpGs (MTSS1, NKX6-2, BTG2) were associated with smoking duration among heavy smokers (>22 cigarettes/day, n = 86) which might relate to long-term heavy-smoking pathology. In purified leukocyte subtypes from an independent group of 20 smokers and 14 nonsmokers we further examined methylation and gene expression for selected genes among CD14+ monocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD19+ B cells, and CD2+ T cells. In 10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers we used RRBS to fine map differential methylation in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+, CD15+, CD19+, and CD56+ natural killer cells. Distinct cell-type differences in smoking-associated methylation and gene expression were identified. AHRR (cg05575921), ALPPL2 (cg21566642), GFI1 (cg09935388), IER3 (cg06126421) and F2RL3 (cg03636183) showed a distinct pattern of significant smoking-associated methylation differences across cell types: granulocytes> monocytes>> B cells. In contrast GPR15 (cg19859270) was highly significant in T and B cells and ITGAL (cg09099830) significant only in T cells. Numerous other CpGs displayed distinctive cell-type responses to tobacco smoke exposure that were not apparent in whole blood DNA. Assessing the overlap between these CpG sites and differential methylated regions (DMRs) with RRBS in 6 cell types, we confirmed cell-type specificity in the context of DMRs. We identified new CpGs associated with current smoking, pack-years, duration, and revealed unique profiles of smoking-associated DNA methylation and gene expression among immune cell types, providing potential clues to hematopoietic lineage-specific effects in disease etiology.},

	Abstract = {Smoking is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Cohort epidemiological studies have demonstrated that women are more vulnerable to cigarette-smoking induced diseases than their male counterparts, however, the molecular basis of these differences has remained unknown. In this study, we explored if there were differences in the gene expression patterns between male and female smokers, and how these patterns might reflect different sex-specific responses to the stress of smoking. Using whole genome microarray gene expression profiling, we found that a substantial number of oxidant related genes were expressed in both male and female smokers, however, smoking-responsive genes did indeed differ greatly between male and female smokers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) against reference oncogenic signature gene sets identified a large number of oncogenic pathway gene-sets that were significantly altered in female smokers compared to male smokers. In addition, functional annotation with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified smoking-correlated genes associated with biological functions in male and female smokers that are directly relevant to well-known smoking related pathologies. However, these relevant biological functions were strikingly overrepresented in female smokers compared to male smokers. IPA network analysis with the functional categories of immune and inflammatory response gene products suggested potential interactions between smoking response and female hormones. Our results demonstrate a striking dichotomy between male and female gene expression responses to smoking. This is the first genome-wide expression study to compare the sex-specific impacts of smoking at a molecular level and suggests a novel potential connection between sex hormone signaling and smoking-induced diseases in female smokers.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation leaves a long-term signature of smoking exposure and is one potential mechanism by which tobacco exposure predisposes to adverse health outcomes, such as cancers, osteoporosis, lung, and cardiovascular disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: To comprehensively determine the association between cigarette smoking and DNA methylation, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation assessed using the Illumina BeadChip 450K array on 15,907 blood derived DNA samples from participants in 16 cohorts (including 2,433 current, 6,518 former, and 6,956 never smokers). Comparing current versus never smokers, 2,623 CpG sites (CpGs), annotated to 1,405 genes, were statistically significantly differentially methylated at Bonferroni threshold of p<1×10(−7) (18,760 CpGs at False Discovery Rate (FDR)<0.05). Genes annotated to these CpGs were enriched for associations with several smoking-related traits in genome-wide studies including pulmonary function, cancers, inflammatory diseases and heart disease. Comparing former versus never smokers, 185 of the CpGs that differed between current and never smokers were significant p<1×10(−7) (2,623 CpGs at FDR<0.05), indicating a pattern of persistent altered methylation, with attenuation, after smoking cessation. Transcriptomic integration identified effects on gene expression at many differentially methylated CpGs. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking has a broad impact on genome-wide methylation that, at many loci, persists many years after smoking cessation. Many of the differentially methylated genes were novel genes with respect to biologic effects of smoking, and might represent therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of tobacco-related diseases. Methylation at these sites could also serve as sensitive and stable biomarkers of lifetime exposure to tobacco smoke.},

	Abstract = {DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic modification, capable of controlling gene expression in the contexts of normal traits or diseases. It is highly dynamic during early embryogenesis and remains relatively stable throughout life, and such patterns are intricately related to human development. DNA methylation is a quantitative trait determined by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic variants at a specific locus can influence both regional and distant DNA methylation. The environment can have varying effects on DNA methylation depending on when the exposure occurs, such as during prenatal life or during adulthood. In particular, cigarette smoking in the context of both current smoking and prenatal exposure is a strong modifier of DNA methylation. Epigenome-wide association studies have uncovered candidate genes associated with cigarette smoking that have biologically relevant functions in the etiology of smoking-related diseases. As such, DNA methylation is a potential mechanistic link between current smoking and cancer, as well as prenatal cigarette-smoke exposure and the development of adult chronic diseases.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the functional consequences of genetic variation, and how it affects complex human disease and quantitative traits, remains a critical challenge for biomedicine. We present an analysis of RNA sequencing data from 1641 samples across 43 tissues from 175 individuals, generated as part of the pilot phase of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We describe the landscape of gene expression across tissues, catalog thousands of tissue-specific and shared regulatory expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants, describe complex network relationships, and identify signals from genome-wide association studies explained by eQTLs. These findings provide a systematic understanding of the cellular and biological consequences of human genetic variation and of the heterogeneity of such effects among a diverse set of human tissues.},

	Abstract = {Transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional processing underlie many cellular and organismal phenotypes. We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes---which is most clearly seen in blood---though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes.},

@article{Holik:2017aa,
	Abstract = {Carefully designed control experiments provide a gold standard for benchmarking different genomics research tools. A shortcoming of many gene expression control studies is that replication involves profiling the same reference RNA sample multiple times. This leads to low, pure technical noise that is atypical of regular studies. To achieve a more realistic noise structure, we generated a RNA-sequencing mixture experiment using two cell lines of the same cancer type. Variability was added by extracting RNA from independent cell cultures and degrading particular samples. The systematic gene expression changes induced by this design allowed benchmarking of different library preparation kits (standard poly-A versus total RNA with Ribozero depletion) and analysis pipelines. Data generated using the total RNA kit had more signal for introns and various RNA classes (ncRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and less variability after degradation. For differential expression analysis, voom with quality weights marginally outperformed other popular methods, while for differential splicing, DEXSeq was simultaneously the most sensitive and the most inconsistent method. For sample deconvolution analysis, DeMix outperformed IsoPure convincingly. Our RNA-sequencing data set provides a valuable resource for benchmarking different protocols and data pre-processing workflows. The extra noise mimics routine lab experiments more closely, ensuring any conclusions are widely applicable.},

Analyses from tumor tissues present limitations; identification of informative marker from blood might be a promising alternative. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and the prognostic value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Experimental Design: From 2011 to 2015, blood samples were prospectively collected from all consecutive patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated in our center. Identification of ctDNA was done with next-generation sequencing targeted on referenced mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and with picoliter droplet digital PCR.Results: A total of 135 patients with resectable (n = 31; 23{\%}), locally advanced (n = 36; 27{\%}), or metastatic (n = 68; 50{\%}) pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included. In patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 104), 48{\%} (n = 50) had ctDNA detectable with a median mutation allelic frequency (MAF) of 6.1{\%}. The presence of ctDNA was strongly correlated with poor overall survival (OS; 6.5 vs. 19.0 months; P \&lt; 0.001) in univariate and multivariate analyses (HR = 1.96; P = 0.007). To evaluate the impact of ctDNA level, patients were grouped according to MAF tertiles: OS were 18.9, 7.8, and 4.9 months (P \&lt; 0.001). Among patients who had curative intent resection (n = 31), 6 had ctDNA detectable after surgery, with an MAF of 4.4{\%}. The presence of ctDNA was associated with a shorter disease-free survival (4.6 vs.17.6 months; P = 0.03) and shorter OS (19.3 vs. 32.2 months; P = 0.027).Conclusions: ctDNA is an independent prognostic marker in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, it arises as an indicator of shorter disease-free survival in resected patients when detected after surgery. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 116--23. {\copyright}2016 AACR.},

	Abstract = {Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis is being incorporated into cancer care; notably in profiling patients to guide treatment decisions. Responses to targeted therapies have been observed in patients with actionable mutations detected in plasma DNA at variant allele fractions (VAFs) below 0.5{\%}. Highly sensitive methods are therefore required for optimal clinical use. To enable objective assessment of assay performance, detailed analytical validation is required. We developed the InVisionFirst({\texttrademark}) assay, an assay based on enhanced tagged amplicon sequencing (eTAm-Seq({\texttrademark})) technology to profile 36 genes commonly mutated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancer types for actionable genomic alterations in cell-free DNA. The assay has been developed to detect point mutations, indels, amplifications and gene fusions that commonly occur in NSCLC. For analytical validation, two 10mL blood tubes were collected from NSCLC patients and healthy volunteer donors. In addition, contrived samples were used to represent a wide spectrum of genetic aberrations and VAFs. Samples were analyzed by multiple operators, at different times and using different reagent Lots. Results were compared with digital PCR (dPCR). The InVisionFirst assay demonstrated an excellent limit of detection, with 99.48{\%} sensitivity for SNVs present at VAF range 0.25{\%}-0.33{\%}, 92.46{\%} sensitivity for indels at 0.25{\%} VAF and a high rate of detection at lower frequencies while retaining high specificity (99.9997{\%} per base). The assay also detected ALK and ROS1 gene fusions, and DNA amplifications in ERBB2, FGFR1, MET and EGFR with high sensitivity and specificity. Comparison between the InVisionFirst assay and dPCR in a series of cancer patients showed high concordance. This analytical validation demonstrated that the InVisionFirst assay is highly sensitive, specific and robust, and meets analytical requirements for clinical applications.},

	Abstract = {We used KRAS mutations to investigate the clinical relevance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) measurements in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Fifty‐three blood samples were collected from 14 prospectively recruited patients prior to chemotherapy (gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX) and subsequently every month during treatment. Samples were processed by density centrifugation and plasma DNA isolation. A Peptide--nucleic acid--clamp PCR was then used to detect KRAS mutations (present in >90{\%} of pancreatic cancers) as a surrogate marker for ctDNA. Plasma samples from 29 healthy individuals were analyzed as a reference group. Results were compared to conventional monitoring measures and survival data. Median follow‐up time was 3.7 months (range 0.6--12.9 months). Ten (71{\%}) patients had a positive KRAS status in the plasma samples obtained prior to chemotherapy, indicating the presence of ctDNA. Among the patients who were ctDNA‐positive before chemotherapy, nine (90{\%}) experienced disease progression during follow‐up, compared to one (25{\%}) of four ctDNA‐negative patients (P = 0.01). The pre‐therapy ctDNA level was a statistically significant predictor of both progression‐free and overall survival (P = 0.014 and 0.010, respectively). Of the 14 patients, ten had ≥2 follow‐up samples; in several of these patients, the ctDNA level changed substantially during the course of chemotherapy. Changes in ctDNA levels corresponded both with radiological follow‐up data and CA19‐9 levels for several patients. This pilot study supports the hypothesis that ctDNA may be used as a marker for monitoring treatment efficacy and disease progression in pancreatic cancer patients. Recruitment of more patients is ongoing to corroborate these findings.},

	Abstract = {Cancer genomics and translational medicine rely on the molecular profiling of patient's tumor obtained during surgery or biopsy. Alternatively, blood is a less invasive source of tumor DNA shed, amongst other ways, as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Highly-sensitive assays capable to detect cancer genetic events from patient's blood plasma became popularly known as liquid biopsy (LqB). Importantly, retrospective studies including small number of selected patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy have shown LqB capable to detect the acquired clonal mutations in RAS genes leading to therapy resistance. However, the usefulness of LqB in the real-life clinical monitoring of these patients still lack additional validation on controlled studies. In this context, we designed a prospective LqB clinical trial to monitor newly diagnosed KRAS wild-type (wt) mCRC patients who received a standard FOLFIRI-cetuximab regimen. We used BEAMing technique for evaluate cfDNA mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA in twenty-five patients during a 2-y period. A total of 2,178 cfDNA mutation analyses were performed and we observed that: a) continued wt circulating status was correlated with a prolonged response; b) smoldering increases in mutant cfDNA were correlated with acquired resistance; while c) mutation upsurge/explosion anticipated a remarkable clinical deterioration. The current study provides evidences, obtained for the first time in an unbiased and prospective manner, that reinforces the utility of LqB for monitoring mCRC patients.},

	Abstract = {Plasma cell-free tumor DNA, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), from liquid biopsy is a potential source of tumor genetic material, in the absence of tissue biopsy, for EGFR testing. Our validation study reiterates the clinical utility of ctDNA next generation sequencing (NGS) for EGFR mutation testing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 163 NSCLC cases were included in the validation, of which 132 patients had paired tissue biopsy and ctDNA. We chose to validate ctDNA using deep sequencing with custom designed bioinformatics methods that could detect somatic mutations at allele frequencies as low as 0.01{\%}. Benchmarking allele specific real time PCR as one of the standard methods for tissue-based EGFR mutation testing, the ctDNA NGS test was validated on all the plasma derived cell-free DNA samples. We observed a high concordance (96.96{\%}) between tissue biopsy and ctDNA for oncogenic driver mutations in Exon 19 and Exon 21 of the EGFR gene. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of the assay were 91.1{\%}, 100{\%} 100{\%}, 95.6{\%}, and 97{\%}, respectively. A false negative rate of 3{\%} was observed. A subset of mutations was also verified on droplet digital PCR. Sixteen percent EGFR mutation positivity was observed in patients where only liquid biopsy was available, thus creating options for targeted therapy. This is the first and largest study from India, demonstrating successful validation of circulating cell-free DNA as a clinically useful material for molecular testing in NSCLC.},

	Abstract = {With dismal survival rate pancreatic cancer remains one of the most aggressive and devastating malignancy. Predominantly, due to the absence of a dependable methodology for early identification and limited therapeutic options for advanced disease. However, it takes over 17 years to develop pancreatic cancer from initiation of mutation to metastatic cancer; therefore, if diagnosed early; it may increase overall survival dramatically, thus, providing a window of opportunity for early detection. Recently, genomic expression analysis defined 4 subtypes of pancreatic cancer based on mutated genes. Hence, we need simple and standard, minimally invasive test that can monitor those altered genes or their associated pathways in time for the success of precision medicine, and liquid biopsy seems to be one answer to all these questions. Again, liquid biopsy has an ability to pair with genomic tests. Additionally, liquid biopsy based development of circulating tumor cells derived xenografts, 3D organoids system, real-time monitoring of genetic mutations by circulating tumor DNA and exosome as the targeted drug delivery vehicle holds lots of potential for the treatment and cure of pancreatic cancer. At present, diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is frantically done on the premise of CA19-9 and radiological features only, which doesn't give a picture of genetic mutations and epigenetic alteration involved. In this manner, the current diagnostic paradigm for pancreatic cancer diagnosis experiences low diagnostic accuracy. This review article discusses the current state of liquid biopsy in pancreatic cancer as diagnostic and therapeutic tools and future perspectives of research in the light of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy using cell-free DNA in maternal plasma has been widely adopted. Recently, NIPT coverage has expanded to detect subchromosomal abnormalities including the 22q11.2 deletion. Validation of a SNP-based NIPT for detection of 22q11.2 deletions demonstrating a high sensitivity (97.8{\%}) and specificity (99.75{\%}) has been reported. We sought to further demonstrate the performance of a revised version of the test in a larger set of pregnancy plasma samples. METHODS: Blood samples from pregnant women (10 with 22q11.2-deletion‒affected fetuses and 390 negative controls) were successfully analyzed using a revised SNP-based NIPT for the 22q11.2 deletion. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were measured. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the assay was 90{\%} (9/10), and specificity of the assay was 99.74{\%} (389/390), with a corresponding false positive-rate of 0.26{\%}. DISCUSSION: The data presented in this study add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of the SNP-based NIPT to detect 22q11.2 deletions with high sensitivity and specificity.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate performance of a single-nucleotide-polymorphism--based noninvasive prenatal screen for fetal aneuploidy in high-risk and low-risk populations upon single venopuncture. METHODS: One thousand sixty-four maternal blood samples from 7 weeks of gestation and beyond were included; one thousand fifty-one were within specifications, 518 (49.3{\%}) low-risk. Cell-free DNA was amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using the Next-generation Aneuploidy Test Using SNPs algorithm. Samples were called as trisomies 21, 18, 13, or monosomy X, or euploid, and male or female. RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty-six samples (91.9{\%}) successfully generated a cell-free DNA result. Among these, sensitivity was 100{\%} for trisomy 21 (58/58, CI: 93.8--100{\%}), trisomy 13 (12/12, CI: 73.5--100{\%}), and fetal sex (358/358 female, CI:99.0--100{\%}; 418/418 male, CI: 99.1--100{\%}), 96.0{\%} for trisomy 18 (24/25, CI: 79.7--99.9{\%}), and 90{\%} for monosomy X (9/10, CI: 55.5--99.8{\%}). Specificity for trisomies 21 and 13 was 100{\%} (905/905 {$[$}CI: 99.6--100{\%}{$]$} and 953/953 {$[$}CI: 99.6--100{\%}{$]$}, respectively) and for trisomy 18 and monosomy X was 99.9{\%} (938/939 {$[$}CI: 99.4--100{\%}{$]$} and 953/954 {$[$}CI: 99.4--100{\%}{$]$}, respectively). However, 16{\%} (20/125) of aneuploid samples did not return a result; 50{\%} (10/20) had a fetal fraction below the 1.5(th) percentile of euploid pregnancies. Aneuploidy rate was significantly higher in these samples (p<0.001, odds ratio: 9.2, CI: 4.4--19.0). Sensitivity and specificity did not differ in low-risk and high-risk populations. CONCLUSIONS: This noninvasive prenatal screen performed with high sensitivity and specificity in high-risk and low-risk cohorts. Aneuploid samples were significantly more likely to not return a result; the number of aneuploidy samples was especially increased among samples with low fetal fraction. This underscores the importance of redraws or, in rare cases, invasive procedures based on low fetal fraction.},

Kappa statistics (unweighted and weighted) are appropriate when the data are nominal or ordinal, whereas the concordance correlation coefficient is more appropriate when the data are measured on a continuous scale. We develop weighted product-moment and concordance correlation coefficients which are applicable for repeated measurements study designs. We consider two distinct situations in which the repeated measurements are paired or unpaired over time. We illustrate the methodology with examples comparing (1) two assays for measuring serum cholesterol, (2) two estimates of dietary intake, from a food frequency questionnaire and dietary recalls, and (3) two measurements of percentage body fat, from skinfold calipers and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer related death in the world with a five-year survival rate of less than 5{\%}. Not all PDAC are the same, because there exist intra-tumoral heterogeneity between PDAC, which poses a great challenge to personalized treatments for PDAC. METHODS: To dissect the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC, we performed a retrospective meta-analysis on whole transcriptome data from more than 1200 PDAC patients. Subtypes were identified based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) biclustering method. We used the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and survival analysis to conduct the molecular and clinical characterization of the identified subtypes, respectively. RESULTS: Six molecular and clinical distinct subtypes of PDAC: L1-L6, are identified and grouped into tumor-specific (L1, L2 and L6) and stroma-specific subtypes (L3, L4 and L5). For tumor-specific subtypes, L1 (\~{} 22{\%}) has enriched carbohydrate metabolism-related gene sets and has intermediate survival. L2 (\~{} 22{\%}) has the worst clinical outcomes, and is enriched for cell proliferation-related gene sets. About 23{\%} patients can be classified into L6, which leads to intermediate survival and is enriched for lipid and protein metabolism-related gene sets. Stroma-specific subtypes may contain high non-epithelial contents such as collagen, immune and islet cells, respectively. For instance, L3 (\~{} 12{\%}) has poor survival and is enriched for collagen-associated gene sets. L4 (\~{} 14{\%}) is enriched for various immune-related gene sets and has relatively good survival. And L5 (\~{} 7{\%}) has good clinical outcomes and is enriched for neurotransmitter and insulin secretion related gene sets. In the meantime, we identified 160 subtype-specific markers and built a deep learning-based classifier for PDAC. We also applied our classification system on validation datasets and observed much similar molecular and clinical characteristics between subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the largest cohort of PDAC gene expression profiles investigated so far, which greatly increased the statistical power and provided more robust results. We identified six molecular and clinical distinct subtypes to describe a more complete picture of the PDAC heterogeneity. The 160 subtype-specific markers and a deep learning based classification system may be used to better stratify PDAC patients for personalized treatments.

@article{Saxonov:2006aa,
	Abstract = {A striking feature of the human genome is the dearth of CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) interrupted occasionally by CpG islands (CGIs), regions with relatively high content of the dinucleotide. CGIs are generally associated with promoters; genes, whose promoters are especially rich in CpG sequences, tend to be expressed in most tissues. However, all working definitions of what constitutes a CGI rely on ad hoc thresholds. Here we adopt a direct and comprehensive survey to identify the locations of all CpGs in the human genome and find that promoters segregate naturally into two classes by CpG content. Seventy-two percent of promoters belong to the class with high CpG content (HCG), and 28{\%} are in the class whose CpG content is characteristic of the overall genome (low CpG content). The enrichment of CpGs in the HCG class is symmetric and peaks around the core promoter. The broad-based expression of the HCG promoters is not a consequence of a correlation with CpG content because within the HCG class the breadth of expression is independent of the CpG content. The overall depletion of CpGs throughout the genome is thought to be a consequence of the methylation of some germ-line CpGs and their susceptibility to mutation. A comparison of the frequencies of inferred deamination mutations at CpG and GpC dinucleotides in the two classes of promoters using SNPs in human-chimpanzee sequence alignments shows that CpGs mutate at a lower frequency in the HCG promoters, suggesting that CpGs in the HCG class are hypomethylated in the germ line.},

Recently, researchers' attention has turn toward epigenetic markers of aging. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on whole blood DNA from a small cohort of 64 subjects of different ages, we identified 3 regions, the CpG islands of ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes, whose methylation level strongly correlates with age. These results were confirmed by the Sequenom's EpiTYPER assay on a larger cohort of 501 subjects from 9 to 99 years, including 7 cord blood samples. Among the 3 genes, ELOVL2 shows a progressive increase in methylation that begins since the very first stage of life (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.92) and appears to be a very promising biomarker of aging.},

	Abstract = {Aging is a progressive process that results in the accumulation of intra- and extracellular alterations that in turn contribute to a reduction in health. Age-related changes in DNA methylation have been reported before and may be responsible for aging-induced changes in gene expression, although a causal relationship has yet to be shown. Using genome-wide assays, we analyzed age-induced changes in DNA methylation and their effect on gene expression with and without transient induction with the synthetic transcription modulating agent WY14,643. To demonstrate feasibility of the approach, we isolated peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) from five young and five old healthy male volunteers and cultured them with or without WY14,643. Infinium 450K BeadChip and Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST expression array analysis revealed significant differential methylation of at least 5 {\%} (ΔYO > 5 {\%}) at 10,625 CpG sites between young and old subjects, but only a subset of the associated genes were also differentially expressed. Age-related differential methylation of previously reported epigenetic biomarkers of aging including ELOVL2, FHL2, PENK, and KLF14 was confirmed in our study, but these genes did not display an age-related change in gene expression in PBMCs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes that lack an age-related expression change predominantly represent genes involved in carcinogenesis and developmental processes, and expression of most of these genes were silenced in PBMCs. No changes in DNA methylation were found in genes displaying transiently induced changes in gene expression. In conclusion, aging-induced differential methylation often targets developmental genes and occurs mostly without change in gene expression.

@article{Valentini:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Gradual changes in the DNA methylation landscape occur throughout aging virtually in all human tissues. A widespread reduction of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), associated with highly reproducible site-specific hypermethylation, characterizes the genome in aging. Therefore, an equilibrium seems to exist between general and directional deregulating events concerning DNA methylation controllers, which may underpin the age-related epigenetic changes. In this context, 5mC-hydroxylases (TET enzymes) are new potential players. In fact, TETs catalyze the stepwise oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), driving the DNA demethylation process based on thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG)-mediated DNA repair pathway. The present paper reports the expression of DNA hydroxymethylation components, the levels of 5hmC and of its derivatives in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of age-stratified donors recruited in several European countries in the context of the EU Project `MARK-AGE'. The results provide evidence for an age-related decline of TET1, TET3 and TDG gene expression along with a decrease of 5hmC and an accumulation of 5caC. These associations were independent of confounding variables, including recruitment center, gender and leukocyte composition. The observed impairment of 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation pathway in blood cells may lead to aberrant transcriptional programs in the elderly.},

@article{Weidner:2014aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human aging is associated with DNA methylation changes at specific sites in the genome. These epigenetic modifications may be used to track donor age for forensic analysis or to estimate biological age. RESULTS: We perform a comprehensive analysis of methylation profiles to narrow down 102 age-related CpG sites in blood. We demonstrate that most of these age-associated methylation changes are reversed in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Methylation levels at three age-related CpGs - located in the genes ITGA2B, ASPA and PDE4C - were subsequently analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing of 151 blood samples. This epigenetic aging signature facilitates age predictions with a mean absolute deviation from chronological age of less than 5 years. This precision is higher than age predictions based on telomere length. Variation of age predictions correlates moderately with clinical and lifestyle parameters supporting the notion that age-associated methylation changes are associated more with biological age than with chronological age. Furthermore, patients with acquired aplastic anemia or dyskeratosis congenita - two diseases associated with progressive bone marrow failure and severe telomere attrition - are predicted to be prematurely aged. CONCLUSIONS: Our epigenetic aging signature provides a simple biomarker to estimate the state of aging in blood. Age-associated DNA methylation changes are counteracted in iPSCs. On the other hand, over-estimation of chronological age in bone marrow failure syndromes is indicative for exhaustion of the hematopoietic cell pool. Thus, epigenetic changes upon aging seem to reflect biological aging of blood.},

Although chronological age has been linked to changes in DNA methylation, the methylome has not yet been used to measure and compare human aging rates. Here, we build a quantitative model of aging using measurements at more than 450,000 CpG markers from the whole blood of 656 human individuals, aged 19 to 101. This model measures the rate at which an individual's methylome ages, which we show is impacted by gender and genetic variants. Furthermore, we show that differences in aging rates help explain epigenetic drift and are reflected in the transcriptome. Our model highlights specific components of the aging process and provides a quantitative read-out for studying the role of methylation in age-related disease.},

Mapping such protein-DNA interactions in vivo using ChIP-seq presents multiple challenges not only in sample preparation and sequencing but also for computational analysis. Here, we present step-by-step guidelines for the computational analysis of ChIP-seq data. We address all the major steps in the analysis of ChIP-seq data: sequencing depth selection, quality checking, mapping, data normalization, assessment of reproducibility, peak calling, differential binding analysis, controlling the false discovery rate, peak annotation, visualization, and motif analysis. At each step in our guidelines we discuss some of the software tools most frequently used. We also highlight the challenges and problems associated with each step in ChIP-seq data analysis. We present a concise workflow for the analysis of ChIP-seq data in Figure 1 that complements and expands on the recommendations of the ENCODE and modENCODE projects.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome tiling array analysis (ChIP-chip) have become standard technologies for genome-wide identification of DNA-binding protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been developed in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as custom annotation tracks. However, summarizing these tracks can be a daunting task, particularly if there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across the genome. RESULTS: We have developed ChIPpeakAnno as a Bioconductor package within the statistical programming environment R to facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) or any experiments resulting in a large number of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites annotated with ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to the nearest genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have implemented functionalities for determining the significance of overlap between replicates or binding sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates. Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve sequences flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification, cloning, or motif discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with adjacent genes. CONCLUSIONS: ChIPpeakAnno enables batch annotation of the binding sites identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any technology that results in a large number of enriched genomic regions within the statistical programming environment R. Allowing users to pass their own annotation data such as a different Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) preparation and a dataset from literature, or existing annotation packages, such as GenomicFeatures and BSgenome, provides flexibility. Tight integration to the biomaRt package enables up-to-date annotation retrieval from the BioMart database.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of high-throughput sequencing in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) has enabled the study of genome-wide protein binding at high resolution. While the amount of data generated from such experiments is steadily increasing, the methods available for their analysis remain limited. Although several algorithms for the analysis of ChIP-seq data have been published they focus almost exclusively on transcription factor studies and are usually not well suited for the analysis of other types of experiments. RESULTS: Here we present ChIPseqR, an algorithm for the analysis of nucleosome positioning and histone modification ChIP-seq experiments. The performance of this novel method is studied on short read sequencing data of Arabidopsis thaliana mononucleosomes as well as on simulated data. CONCLUSIONS: ChIPseqR is shown to improve sensitivity and spatial resolution over existing methods while maintaining high specificity. Further analysis of predicted nucleosomes reveals characteristic patterns in nucleosome sequences and placement.},

	Abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become a valuable and widely used approach for mapping the genomic location of transcription-factor binding and histone modifications in living cells. Despite its widespread use, there are considerable differences in how these experiments are conducted, how the results are scored and evaluated for quality, and how the data and metadata are archived for public use. These practices affect the quality and utility of any global ChIP experiment. Through our experience in performing ChIP-seq experiments, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have developed a set of working standards and guidelines for ChIP experiments that are updated routinely. The current guidelines address antibody validation, experimental replication, sequencing depth, data and metadata reporting, and data quality assessment. We discuss how ChIP quality, assessed in these ways, affects different uses of ChIP-seq data. All data sets used in the analysis have been deposited for public viewing and downloading at the ENCODE (http://encodeproject.org/ENCODE/) and modENCODE (http://www.modencode.org/) portals.},

While a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established microarray alternative (ChIP-chip), few approaches have been described for processing ChIP-seq data. To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein binding positions with high accuracy. Using three separate datasets, we illustrate new methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We also compare sensitivity and spatial precision of several novel and previously described binding detection algorithms. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.},

An important scientific application is to identify changes in protein binding between different treatment conditions, i.e. to detect differential binding. This can reveal potential mechanisms through which changes in binding may contribute to the treatment effect. The csaw package provides a framework for the de novo detection of differentially bound genomic regions. It uses a window-based strategy to summarize read counts across the genome. It exploits existing statistical software to test for significant differences in each window. Finally, it clusters windows into regions for output and controls the false discovery rate properly over all detected regions. The csaw package can handle arbitrarily complex experimental designs involving biological replicates. It can be applied to both transcription factor and histone mark datasets, and, more generally, to any type of sequencing data measuring genomic coverage. csaw performs favorably against existing methods for de novo DB analyses on both simulated and real data. csaw is implemented as a R software package and is freely available from the open-source Bioconductor project.},

@article{Liao:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

Hence, identifying differential binding sites across multiple conditions is of practical importance in biological and medical research. To this end, we have developed a powerful and flexible program, called DBChIP, to detect differentially bound sharp binding sites across multiple conditions, with or without matching control samples. By assigning uncertainty measure to the putative differential binding sites, DBChIP facilitates downstream analysis. DBChIP is implemented in R programming language and can work with a wide range of sequencing file formats.

	Abstract = {Oestrogen receptor-α(ER) is the defining and driving transcription factor in the majority of breast cancers and its target genes dictate cell growth and endocrine response, yet genomic understanding of ER function has been restricted to model systems(1-3). We now map genome-wide ER binding events, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcome and in distant ER positive (ER+) metastases. We find that drug resistant cancers still have ER-chromatin occupancy, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with the acquisition of unique ER binding regions in tumours from patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired, poor outcome ER regulatory regions observed in primary tumours reveal gene signatures that predict clinical outcome in ER+ disease exclusively. We find that the differential ER binding programme observed in tumours from patients with poor outcome is not due to the selection of a rare subpopulation of cells, but is due to the FoxA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid time scale. The parallel redistribution of ER and FoxA1 cis-regulatory elements in drug resistant cellular contexts is supported by histological co-expression of ER and FoxA1 in metastatic samples. By establishing transcription factor mapping in primary tumour material, we show that there is plasticity in ER binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements linked with the different clinical outcomes.},

	Abstract = {A common aim in ChIP-seq experiments is to identify changes in protein binding patterns between conditions, i.e. differential binding. A number of peak- and window-based strategies have been developed to detect differential binding when the regions of interest are not known in advance. However, careful consideration of error control is needed when applying these methods. Peak-based approaches use the same data set to define peaks and to detect differential binding. Done improperly, this can result in loss of type I error control. For window-based methods, controlling the false discovery rate over all detected windows does not guarantee control across all detected regions. Misinterpreting the former as the latter can result in unexpected liberalness. Here, several solutions are presented to maintain error control for these de novo counting strategies. For peak-based methods, peak calling should be performed on pooled libraries prior to the statistical analysis. For window-based methods, a hybrid approach using Simes'method is proposed to maintain control of the false discovery rate across regions. More generally, the relative advantages of peak- and window-based strategies are explored using a range of simulated and real data sets. Implementations of both strategies also compare favourably to existing programs for differential binding analyses.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group. Results: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems. Availability: ROAST is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.org Contact: smyth{\char64}wehi.edu.au Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

The most widely used methods successfully test whether the true differential expression is different from zero, but give no assurance that the differences found are large enough to be biologically meaningful. Results: We present a method, t-tests relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors.

	Abstract = {Variations in sample quality are frequently encountered in small RNA-sequencing experiments, and pose a major challenge in a differential expression analysis. Removal of high variation samples reduces noise, but at a cost of reducing power, thus limiting our ability to detect biologically meaningful changes. Similarly, retaining these samples in the analysis may not reveal any statistically significant changes due to the higher noise level. A compromise is to use all available data, but to down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with observational level weights obtained from the mean--variance relationship of the log-counts-per-million using `voom'. A comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and experimental RNA-sequencing data demonstrates that this strategy leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This methodology has wide application and is implemented in the open-source `limma'package.},

@article{McCarthy:2012aa,
	Abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

Such alternative exon usage is thought to contribute to the ability of organisms to generate different cell types and tissues from a single genome. However, recent evidence has also suggested that much alternative exon usage might be noise with no particular function. We reconcile these two views by comparing how exons are used in different tissues and for which exons these usage patterns across tissues change or stay similar (are ``conserved'') in several primate species. The latter case is an indication that the pattern is of functional importance, and our analysis quantifies how widespread such cases are.},

	Abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

	Abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.

The voom method estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and enters these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods. Two case studies illustrate the use of linear modeling and gene set testing methods.},

Given their prevalence in the human genome, close correlation with gene expression, and high chemical stability, these DNA epigenetic marks could serve as ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Taking advantage of a highly sensitive and selective chemical labeling technology (3), we report here genome-wide 5hmC profiling in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and in genomic DNA of paired tumor/adjacent tissues collected from a cohort of 90 healthy individuals and 260 patients recently diagnosed with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, liver, or thyroid cancer. 5hmC was mainly distributed in transcriptionally active regions coincident with open chromatin and permissive histone modifications. Robust cancer-associated 5hmC signatures in cfDNA were identified with specificity for different cancers. 5hmC-based biomarkers of circulating cfDNA demonstrated highly accurate predictive value for patients with colorectal and gastric cancers versus healthy controls, superior to conventional biomarkers, and comparable to 5hmC biomarkers from tissue biopsies. This new strategy could lead to the development of effective blood-based, minimally-invasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis approaches.},

Here we explored the diagnostic potential of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using a sensitive chemical labeling-based low-input shotgun sequencing approach. We sequenced cell-free 5hmC from 49 patients of seven different cancer types and found distinct features that could be used to predict cancer types and stages with high accuracy. Specifically, we discovered that lung cancer leads to a progressive global loss of 5hmC in cfDNA, whereas hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer lead to disease-specific changes in the cell-free hydroxymethylome. Our proof of principle results suggest that cell-free 5hmC signatures may potentially be used not only to identify cancer types but also to track tumor stage in some cancers.},

	Abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into AML pathophysiology.},

In particular, genome-wide single-cell measurements such as transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of cellular composition as well as functional variation in homogenic cell populations. An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that belong to the same cell types based on gene expression patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes).Results: In this article, we describe a novel algorithm named shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-Cliq that clusters single-cell transcriptomes. SNN-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling high-dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real experimental datasets, SNN-Cliq outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested. More importantly, the clustering results of SNN-Cliq reflect the cell types or origins with high accuracy.Availability and implementation: The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and Python.

PCA and related methods may directly provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable that is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model. An unsolved problem in this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (PCs) (and other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting.Results: We introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly associated with any subset or linear combination of PCs. The proposed method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered in genomics and can be used to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios. We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell-cycle regulated with an accurate measure of statistical significance. We also analyze gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression data to provide a molecularly driven phenotype. Using our method, we find a greater enrichment for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis that uses a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype. The proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale quantifications of systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses.Availability and implementation: An R software package, called jackstraw, is available in CRAN.Contact: jstorey{\char64}princeton.edu},

However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

Drop-Seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts'cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes.

	Abstract = {Defects in the mismatch repair system lead to microsatellite instability (MSI), a feature observed in ∼15{\%} of all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Microsatellite mutations that drive tumourigenesis, typically inactivation of tumour suppressors, are selected for and are frequently detected in MSI cancers. Here, we evaluated somatic mutations in microsatellite repeats of 790 genes chosen based on reduced expression in MSI CRC and existence of a coding mononucleotide repeat of 6--10 bp in length. All the repeats were initially sequenced in 30 primary MSI CRC samples and whenever frameshift mutations were identified in >20{\%}, additional 70 samples were sequenced. To distinguish driver mutations from passengers, we similarly analyzed the occurrence of frameshift mutations in 121 intronic control repeats and utilized a statistical regression model to determine cut-off mutation frequencies for repeats of all types (A/T and C/G, 6--10 bp). Along with several know target genes, including TGFBR2, ACVR2, and MSH3, six novel candidate driver genes emerged that harbored significantly more mutations than identical control repeats. The mutation frequencies in 100 MSI CRC samples were 51{\%} in G8 of GLYR1, 47{\%} in T9 of ABCC5, 43{\%} in G8 of WDTC1, 33{\%} in A8 of ROCK1, 30{\%} in T8 of OR51E2, and 28{\%} in A8 of TCEB3. Immunohistochemical staining of GLYR1 revealed defective protein expression in tumors carrying biallelic mutations, supporting a loss of function hypothesis. This is a large scale, unbiased effort to identify genes that when mutated are likely to contribute to MSI CRC development.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer develops through two main genetic instability pathways characterized by distinct pathologic features and clinical outcome. RESULTS: We investigated colon cancer samples (23 characterized by microsatellite stability, MSS, and 16 by high microsatellite instability, MSI-H) for genome-wide expression of microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA. Based on combined miRNA and mRNA gene expression, a molecular signature consisting of twenty seven differentially expressed genes, inclusive of 8 miRNAs, could correctly distinguish MSI-H versus MSS colon cancer samples. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, various members of the oncogenic miR-17-92 family were significantly up-regulated in MSS cancers. The majority of protein coding genes were also up-regulated in MSS cancers. Their functional classification revealed that they were most frequently associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, repair, gastrointestinal disease and immune response. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that indicates the existence of differences in miRNA expression between MSS versus MSI-H colorectal cancers. In addition, the work suggests that the combination of mRNA/miRNA expression signatures may represent a general approach for improving bio-molecular classification of human cancer.},

@article{Kirzin:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Sporadic early onset colorectal carcinoma (EOCRC) which has by definition no identified hereditary predisposition is a growing problem that remains poorly understood. Molecular analysis could improve identification of distinct sub-types of colorectal cancers (CRC) with therapeutic implications and thus can help establish that sporadic EOCRC is a distinct entity. From 954 patients resected for CRC at our institution, 98 patients were selected. Patients aged 45--60 years were excluded to help define ``young''and ``old''groups. Thirty-nine cases of sporadic EOCRC (patients≤45 years with microsatellite stable tumors) were compared to both microsatellite stable tumors from older patients (36 cases, patients>60 years) and to groups of patients with microsatellite instability. Each group was tested for TP53, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations and the presence of a methylator phenotype. Gene expression profiles were also used for pathway analysis. Compared to microsatellite stable CRC from old patients, sporadic EOCRC were characterized by distal location, frequent synchronous metastases and infrequent synchronous adenomas but did not have specific morphological characteristics. A familial history of CRC was more common in sporadic EOCRC patients despite a lack of identified hereditary conditions (p = 0.013). Genetic studies also showed the absence of BRAF mutations (p = 0.022) and the methylator phenotype (p = 0.005) in sporadic EOCRC compared to older patients. Gene expression analysis implicated key pathways such as Wnt/beta catenin, MAP Kinase, growth factor signaling (EGFR, HGF, PDGF) and the TNFR1 pathway in sporadic EOCRC. Wnt/beta catenin signaling activation was confirmed by aberrant nuclear beta catenin immunostaining (p = 0.01). This study strongly suggests that sporadic EOCRC is a distinct clinico-molecular entity presenting as a distal and aggressive disease associated with chromosome instability. Furthermore, several signaling pathways including the TNFR1 pathway have been identified as potential biomarkers for both the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.},

@article{Kruhoffer:2005aa,
	Abstract = {The majority of microsatellite instable (MSI) colorectal cancers are sporadic, but a subset belongs to the syndrome hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Microsatellite instability is caused by dysfunction of the mismatch repair (MMR) system that leads to a mutator phenotype, and MSI is correlated to prognosis and response to chemotherapy. Gene expression signatures as predictive markers are being developed for many cancers, and the identification of a signature for MMR deficiency would be of interest both clinically and biologically. To address this issue, we profiled the gene expression of 101 stage II and III colorectal cancers (34 MSI, 67 microsatellite stable (MSS)) using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. From these data, we constructed a nine-gene signature capable of separating the mismatch repair proficient and deficient tumours. Subsequently, we demonstrated the robustness of the signature by transferring it to a real-time RT-PCR platform. Using this platform, the signature was validated on an independent test set consisting of 47 tumours (10 MSI, 37 MSS), of which 45 were correctly classified. In a second step, we constructed a signature capable of separating MMR-deficient tumours into sporadic MSI and HNPCC cases, and validated this by a mathematical cross-validation approach. The demonstration that this two-step classification approach can identify MSI as well as HNPCC cases merits further gene expression studies to identify prognostic signatures.},

However, infrequent MSI (MSI-L) has not been attributable to any other defined molecular pathway, and its existence as a biologically distinct category has been challenged. Moreover, the global molecular phenotypes (GMPs) underlying MSI-H, MSI-L, or microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors have never been evaluated. To evaluate the impact of MSI status on GMP and to determine the importance of MSI relative to other molecular and clinical features, cDNA microarray-derived data from 41 colon cancers were interpreted using principal components analysis. The clinically relevant principal component with the greatest impact on GMP was component 3, which distinguished MSI-H from non-MSI-H (i.e., MSI-L and microsatellite stable) tumors and was designated the MSI-H separator. Notably, MSI-L cancers were also clearly distinguished from non-MSI-L tumors by another principle component, component 10 (the ``MSI-L separator''). This second finding validates the existence of MSI-L tumors as a distinct molecular phenotypic category. Thus, both components 3 and 10 reflected different aspects of MSI and helped to establish principal components analysis as a useful tool to identify and characterize distinct biological features of human malignancy. {\copyright}2003 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous and biologically poorly understood disease. To tailor CRC treatment, it is essential to first model this heterogeneity by defining subtypes of patients with homogeneous biological and clinical characteristics and second match these subtypes to cell lines for which extensive pharmacological data is available, thus linking targeted therapies to patients most likely to respond to treatment. METHODS: We applied a new unsupervised, iterative approach to stratify CRC tumor samples into subtypes based on genome-wide mRNA expression data. By applying this stratification to several CRC cell line panels and integrating pharmacological response data, we generated hypotheses regarding the targeted treatment of different subtypes. RESULTS: In agreement with earlier studies, the two dominant CRC subtypes are highly correlated with a gene expression signature of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). Notably, further dividing these two subtypes using iNMF (iterative Non-negative Matrix Factorization) revealed five subtypes that exhibit activation of specific signaling pathways, and show significant differences in clinical and molecular characteristics. Importantly, we were able to validate the stratification on independent, published datasets comprising over 1600 samples. Application of this stratification to four CRC cell line panels comprising 74 different cell lines, showed that the tumor subtypes are well represented in available CRC cell line panels. Pharmacological response data for targeted inhibitors of SRC, WNT, GSK3b, aurora kinase, PI3 kinase, and mTOR, showed significant differences in sensitivity across cell lines assigned to different subtypes. Importantly, some of these differences in sensitivity were in concordance with high expression of the targets or activation of the corresponding pathways in primary tumor samples of the same subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The stratification presented here is robust, captures important features of CRC, and offers valuable insight into functional differences between CRC subtypes. By matching the identified subtypes to cell line panels that have been pharmacologically characterized, it opens up new possibilities for the development and application of targeted therapies for defined CRC patient sub-populations.},

	N2 = {Background: miRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Genetic variation in miRNA-encoding sequences or their corresponding binding sites may affect the fidelity of the miRNA--mRNA interaction and subsequently alter the risk of cancer development. Methods: This study expanded the search for miRNA-related polymorphisms contributing to the etiology of colorectal cancer across the genome using a novel platform, the Axiom miRNA Target Site Genotyping Array (237,858 markers). After quality control, the study included 596 cases and 429 controls from the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, a population-based case--control study of colorectal cancer in northern Israel. The association between each marker and colorectal cancer status was examined assuming a log-additive genetic model using logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, and two principal components. Results: Twenty-three markers had P values less than 5.0E−04, and the most statistically significant association involved rs2985 (chr6:34845648; intronic of UHRF1BP1; OR = 0.66; P = 3.7E−05). Furthermore, this study replicated a previously published risk locus, rs1051690, in the 3′-untranslated region of the insulin receptor gene INSR (OR = 1.38; P = 0.03), with strong evidence of differences in INSR gene expression by genotype. Conclusions: This study is the first to examine associations between genetic variation in miRNA target sites and colorectal cancer using a genome-wide approach. Functional studies to identify allele-specific effects on miRNA binding are needed to confirm the regulatory capacity of genetic variation to influence risk of colorectal cancer. Impact: This study demonstrates the potential for an miRNA-targeted genome-wide association study to identify candidate susceptibility loci and prioritize them for functional characterization.

We describe a robust gene expression-based molecular classification of GBM into Proneural, Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal subtypes and integrate multi-dimensional genomic data to establish patterns of somatic mutations and DNA copy number. Aberrations and gene expression of EGFR, NF1, and PDGFRA/IDH1 each define Classical, Mesenchymal, and Proneural, respectively. Gene signatures of normal brain cell types show a strong relation between subtypes and different neural lineages. Additionally, response to aggressive therapy differs by subtype with greatest benefit in Classical and no benefit in Proneural.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction methods are increasingly used in biosciences to forecast diverse features and characteristics. Binary two-state classifiers are the most common applications. They are usually based on machine learning approaches. For the end user it is often problematic to evaluate the true performance and applicability of computational tools as some knowledge about computer science and statistics would be needed. RESULTS: Instructions are given on how to interpret and compare method evaluation results. For systematic method performance analysis is needed established benchmark datasets which contain cases with known outcome, and suitable evaluation measures. The criteria for benchmark datasets are discussed along with their implementation in VariBench, benchmark database for variations. There is no single measure that alone could describe all the aspects of method performance. Predictions of genetic variation effects on DNA, RNA and protein level are important as information about variants can be produced much faster than their disease relevance can be experimentally verified. Therefore numerous prediction tools have been developed, however, systematic analyses of their performance and comparison have just started to emerge. CONCLUSIONS: The end users of prediction tools should be able to understand how evaluation is done and how to interpret the results. Six main performance evaluation measures are introduced. These include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Together with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis they provide a good picture about the performance of methods and allow their objective and quantitative comparison. A checklist of items to look at is provided. Comparisons of methods for missense variant tolerance, protein stability changes due to amino acid substitutions, and effects of variations on mRNA splicing are presented.},

	N2 = {Promoter methylation of the mismatch repair gene plays a key role in sporadic microsatellite instability (MSI) colorectal cancers. However, promoter methylation often occurs in proximal colon cancers, and molecular phenotypes underlying MSI cancers in distal colon have not been fully clarified. Our goal was to clarify the difference between MSI and microsatellite stability (MSS) cancers and, furthermore, to determine distinct characteristics of proximal and distal MSI cancers. By DNA microarray analysis of 84 cancers (33 MSI and 51 MSS), we identified discriminating genes (177 probe sets), which predicted MSI status with a high accuracy rate (97.6{\%}). These genes were related to phenotypic characteristics of MSI cancers. Next, we identified 24 probe sets that were differentially expressed in proximal and distal MSI cancers. These genes included promoter methylation-mediated genes, whose expression was significantly down-regulated in proximal MSI cancers. Among discriminating genes between MSI and MSS, nine methylation-mediated genes showed down-regulation in MSI cancers. Of these, 7 (77.8{\%}) showed down-regulation in proximal MSI cancers. Furthermore, methylation-specific PCR confirmed that frequency of hMLH1 promoter methylation was significantly higher in proximal MSI cancers (P = 0.0317). These results suggested that there is a difference between proximal and distal MSI cancers in methylation-mediated influence on gene silencing. In conclusion, using DNA microarray, we could distinguish MSI and MSS cancers. We also showed distinct characteristics of proximal and distal MSI cancers. The inactivation form of hMLH, per se, differed between proximal and distal MSI cancers. These results suggested that distal MSI cancers constitute a distinct subgroup of sporadic MSI cancers.

The LOH ratio was defined as the frequency of LOH in chromosomes 2p, 5q, 17p, and 18q.

We used microarrays to identify a gene signature that could classify the CIN phenotype and evaluated its ability to predict prognosis. Results CIN high showed the worst survival (P < .001), whereas there was no significant difference between CIN low and MSI high.
